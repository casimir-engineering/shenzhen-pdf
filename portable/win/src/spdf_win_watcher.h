/* spdf_win_watcher.h — a document changed on disk: notice it, coalesce it, tell
 * the tab; and read-only sources opened as a silent shadow copy.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS THE PORT OF. GTK4's spdf_watcher.c (a GFileMonitor per tab,
 * 500 ms trailing-edge debounce, an authoritative size+mtime comparison against
 * a baseline so the app's own saves never self-trigger, a 5 x 250 ms grace
 * before a missing file is reported) and the mac's SPDFMacFileWatcher (FSEvents
 * on the PARENT DIRECTORY, keyed to the file name, because an atomic save --
 * write-temp then rename -- invalidates any handle on the original file). The
 * decisions are in spdf_win_watcher_logic.h; this file is the Win32 plumbing.
 *
 * THE WIN32 SHAPE. ReadDirectoryChangesW on the document's directory, from a
 * worker thread per watch that does nothing but wait and post; the events land
 * on the UI thread through a message-only window this module owns, where the
 * debounce timer runs and the subscriber's callback is invoked. So the tabs
 * layer subscribes with a plain callback and never sees a thread, a handle or a
 * message -- the same division spdf_win_render.c makes for the render workers.
 * The callback always runs on the thread that created the watcher.
 *
 * READ-ONLY SHADOW COPIES (26.6.27-2, mac commit 4492586ea): a source the
 * process cannot write is rendered from a private, persistent copy in
 * <state dir>\ReadOnlyCopies\ro-<sha256>.<ext>. The tab's IDENTITY -- its path,
 * title, recents entry, session entry -- stays on the source; only the path
 * handed to spdf_open changes. The copy is refreshed from the source only when
 * the source's stat changed; an unchanged source reopens the existing copy with
 * no content read. The session keys readOnly / workingPath / roCopyFileSize /
 * roCopyModifiedAt (already carried by session.yaml) are the binding this
 * module hands out and takes back on restore. Save As converts: the tab is
 * repointed at the written file and its copy is dropped when no other tab
 * shares it.
 *
 * WHAT THE TABS LAYER MUST DO -- the wiring, in order:
 *   open      r = spdf_win_watcher_resolve_open(path, &res);
 *             spdf_open(res.read_only && res.working_path[0] ? res.working_path : path)
 *             then spdf_win_watcher_watch(w, path, on_change, tab)
 *   restore   spdf_win_watcher_prime_restore(path, workingPath, roCopyFileSize,
 *             roCopyModifiedAt) BEFORE the tab is first shown
 *   on_change SPDF_WIN_WATCH_CHANGED: reopen through the same resolve (a
 *             shadow tab gets a refreshed copy), swap the document, keep the
 *             scroll; SPDF_WIN_WATCH_MISSING: mark the tab stale
 *   self save spdf_win_watcher_note_self_save(w, id) after the app wrote the file
 *   close     spdf_win_watcher_unwatch(w, id); on a DELIBERATE close also
 *             spdf_win_watcher_release_copy(working_path, shared_by_another_tab)
 *   Save As   spdf_win_watcher_release_copy(old working path, shared), then
 *             unwatch + watch the new path
