/* spdf_win_md_commands.h -- what the A-/A+ pill and the image cache do to the
 * window: the Markdown commands, in the shape spdf_win_chrome_commands.h's
 * switch expects.
 *
 * Header-only and included by spdf_win_main.cpp AFTER `struct app` and
 * spdf_win_chrome_actions.h (it calls show_selected_tab and
 * spdf_win_tabs_app_remember) and BEFORE spdf_win_chrome_commands.h, which
 * dispatches to it. Same arrangement as the other chrome_*.h headers beside
 * it; not part of the port's public surface.
 *
 * WHY A TEXT-SIZE CHANGE IS A TAB RE-SHOW. The size is the em MuPDF laid the
 * document out at, so changing it means a new layout, and every handle open on
 * the document -- the canvas, its render workers, the thumbnail strip -- must
 * move to the new one together or their page numbers disagree.
 * show_selected_tab() is exactly that already: it destroys the canvas (and
 * with it the worker threads and their per-thread handles), reopens the tab's
 * document through the tabs hook (spdf_win_md_open_any, which reads the new
 * scale), and builds a fresh canvas that puts the reader back on the page it
 * was on. The reader's page is written back first so the reopened document
 * lands where they were, as a tab switch does. No new machinery, and a PDF tab
 * is untouched: the commands are inert on it.
 *
 * REMOTE IMAGES ARRIVE THE SAME WAY. When the background fetch has filled the
 * cache, its window message re-shows the tab; the converter now finds the
 * files and the placeholders become pictures. spdf_win_md_command_images_arrived
 * is that handler, and spdf_win_md_command_after_open starts the fetch after a
 * Markdown tab is shown -- both one call each from main.cpp.
