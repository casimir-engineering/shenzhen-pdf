/* COMMAND HANDLERS: search, match navigation, the results sidebar and the map.
 *
 * Header-only, included from spdf_win_chrome_commands.h only, after the app
 * struct, the chrome model and the input types are complete -- the same
 * arrangement as every other *_commands/*_actions header in this port. Owned
 * by the parity track of that name (portable/docs/windows-feature-matrix.md);
 * the other tracks have their own and none of them edits command_perform().
 *
 * Return 1 when the command was consumed, 0 to let it fall through.
 *
 * WHAT EACH ONE DOES, with its original:
 *
 *   FIND            Ctrl+F with a live selection searches for it at once, the
 *                   query replacing whatever was in the field (Mac focusFind,
 *                   ShenzhenPDFMac.mm:12134; GTK spdf_search_focus). With no
 *                   selection, or the selection already being the query, it
 *                   only gives the field the keyboard, as before.
 *   FIND_NEXT/PREV  step, and CENTRE the match (scrollToPageRect), not its page.
 *   FIND_REGEX_MULTILINE  toggles the process-wide flag; the running search
 *                   reruns on the next paint (toggleFindRegexMultiline :12171).
 *   PASTE_SEARCH    Ctrl+V with no field focused searches for the clipboard
 *                   text, trimmed and whitespace-collapsed (Mac paste: :12151);
 *                   with a field focused it pastes INTO the field, which is
 *                   what the field editor does on macOS.
 *   SELECT_ALL      Ctrl+A selects every glyph on the current page. Neither
 *                   original has a document-level Select All (the Mac menu
 *                   item reaches only text fields), so this is the Windows
 *                   reading of the pre-declared command: the whole visible
 *                   page, through the same gesture a drag across it performs.
 *   ROTATE_CW/CCW   rotate the current page in the document AND SAVE THE FILE,
 *                   as both originals do (rotateCurrentPageByDegrees :14875
 *                   saves; GTK annot_rotate_cont saves or reloads), then tell
 *                   the canvas, the find session and the panels the page
 *                   changed shape. A non-PDF, or a save that fails, is reported
 *                   and nothing on screen changes.
