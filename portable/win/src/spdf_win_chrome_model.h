/* spdf_win_chrome_model.h — build a chrome model from the app's tab state.
 *
 * Its own translation unit rather than a few lines in spdf_win_main.cpp for the
 * reason tools/file-size-limits.md gives: that file is at its 500-line cap and
 * the repo prefers extracting a focused file over raising one. It also keeps the
 * UTF-8-to-UTF-16 title conversion in one place, which is where the storage for
 * those titles has to live anyway.
 *
 * WHY A STORE. SpdfWinChromeModel borrows its title strings, because the painter
 * must not allocate. The tab model owns UTF-8 titles, and the strip needs UTF-16.
 * Something has to own the converted strings for the duration of a paint, and a
 * caller-provided store makes that ownership explicit and stack-allocatable
 * instead of hiding a malloc on the paint path.

 * neither the window nor this file, so the state has to be somewhere both can
 * reach without either learning the other's types. One window per process
 * (multi-window is multi-process, per session.yaml's window ids), so a
 * process-wide value is the whole truth.

 * rather than at every caller -- and rather than in the model builder, which
 * runs once per frame.

 * worker thread and no second document handle: spdf_win_find_shared() checks
 * this stored query exactly as it used to check the environment. `query` NULL or
 * empty cancels any live search and clears the toolbar's readout.
