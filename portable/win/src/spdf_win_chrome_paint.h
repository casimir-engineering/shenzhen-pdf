/* spdf_win_chrome_paint.h — drawing the Win32 chrome.
 *
 * SAME RULE AS spdf_win_d2d.h, AND FOR THE SAME REASON: nothing here may
 * require an HWND. Every function takes an ID2D1RenderTarget* and rects that
 * spdf_win_chrome.h computed, so the chrome is drawn identically by the window's
 * WM_PAINT and by the headless WIC target. That is not a style preference: the
 * live window's client area was measured byte-identical to the offscreen
 * compose path (portable/docs/windows-native-observations.md §0), so keeping
 * chrome inside that path is what makes chrome pixel-testable at all.
 *
 * Split into one translation unit per region -- strip, toolbar, panels -- so the
 * files stay small and so tracks working on different chrome do not collide.
 * They share the theme (spdf_win_chrome_theme.h), the geometry
 * (spdf_win_chrome.h, spdf_win_tabstrip.h) and the small brush/text helpers
 * declared at the bottom of this header.
 *
 * C++ only: these take ID2D1RenderTarget and IDWriteFactory by pointer and call
 * methods on them. Unlike spdf_win_d2d.h there is no C consumer to keep happy.
