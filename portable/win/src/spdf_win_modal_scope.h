/* spdf_win_modal_scope.h — one rule, made structural: NO DIALOG MAY LEAVE ITS
 * OWNER DISABLED.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. A Win32 window that is disabled cannot be activated by
 * a click, by Alt+Tab, or by SetForegroundWindow. If the dialog that disabled
 * it is invisible, off-screen, on another thread, or never appeared at all, the
 * app is indistinguishable from a hung one: it repaints, it answers WM_NULL,
 * it is not marked "not responding" -- and no input reaches it. That is the
 * exact shape of the report this file was written for ("the app was never
 * responsive to any user input and not even focusable"), and section 14 of
 * portable/docs/windows-native-observations.md is the measurement.
 *
 * Before this header every modal site in the port spelled the same four lines
 * out by hand:
 *
 *     if (parent) was_enabled = IsWindowEnabled(parent);
 *     if (parent && was_enabled) EnableWindow(parent, FALSE);
 *     ... a message loop, or a system dialog ...
 *     if (parent && was_enabled) { EnableWindow(parent, TRUE); SetForegroundWindow(parent); }
 *
 * Correct in each place, and correct only for as long as no path leaves between
 * the second line and the fourth. A scope cannot be left: the destructor runs
 * on the early return, on the exception, and on the watchdog giving up.
 *
 * WHAT THE SCOPE ADDS BEYOND "re-enable":
 *
 *   THE OWNER'S THREAD. EnableWindow is a cross-thread operation, so a dialog
 *   run on a WORKER thread against a main-window owner disables that owner from
 *   a thread that does not own it and cannot be reasoned about. No site in this
 *   port does that today; if one is ever added, the scope REFUSES the disable
 *   rather than performing it -- a dialog that is merely not modal is a bug you
 *   can see and click your way out of, a main window disabled from a foreign
 *   thread is not.
 *
 *   ACTIVATION. Windows does not reliably hand the foreground back to the owner
 *   after a dialog that ran on another thread, or after one that failed to
 *   appear (TaskDialogIndirect answers E_* when the Common Controls 6 assembly
 *   is not active; DialogBoxParam answers -1). The scope restores it -- but
 *   only when this process held the foreground when the scope opened, so a
 *   dialog finishing in the background never steals the reader's focus from
 *   whatever they moved to.
 *
 *   PLACEMENT. A dialog created at CW_USEDEFAULT is cascaded onto the PRIMARY
 *   monitor, not the owner's; with the app on a second display the reader is
 *   left with a disabled window and a modal dialog they cannot see.
 *   spdf_win_modal_place_point() is the pure geometry (centre on the owner,
 *   then clamp into that monitor's work area) and is covered headlessly by
 *   portable/win/tests/modal_scope_test.c.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT DO. It does not run a message loop and it does not know what
 * a dialog is. Sites keep their own loops; this only owns the enable/disable
 * and the activation that go around one.
