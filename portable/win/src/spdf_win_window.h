 *    caption and the minimap thumbnails, which read the flag later, went dark. A
 *    half-dark window is a worse bug than the one being fixed.
 *
 * 2. WINDOWED PATHS ONLY. --render-png and --render-window-png must not consult
 *    it: their output would start depending on a registry value on whichever
 *    machine runs them, so every pixel comparison in this port would quietly
 *    read the developer's personal setting. That is exactly what
