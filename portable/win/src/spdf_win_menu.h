/* spdf_win_menu.h — every command the Windows shell can be asked to run, as
 * data: one table of (command, menu, title, accelerator).
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS. The Win32 answer to portable/linux/gtk4/spdf_shortcuts.c, which
 * is "the single registry of every GAction name in the GTK4 shell, with
 * accelerators (Mac map, Cmd -> Ctrl) and the F1 cheat sheet, which is a
 * GtkShortcutsWindow generated from the same table so the two can never drift
 * apart". Same discipline, same reason: the menu bar, the keyboard and (later) a
 * command palette must offer exactly one set of commands, and the only way that
 * survives edits is for all three to read one table.
 *
 * WHY THE TABLE IS PURE AND HEADER-ONLY, when the thing it builds is an HMENU.
 * spdf_win_chrome.h's second rule -- "hit-testing and painting agree only if
 * they call the same functions" -- has a keyboard analogue: the accelerator
 * PRINTED next to a menu item and the accelerator that actually FIRES agree only
 * if they come from the same row. So the row carries both, and matching a
 * keystroke to a command is a pure function a plain C test can drive with no
 * window, no menu and no message pump (portable/win/tests/menu_test.c). Only the
 * HMENU construction, the popup menus and the file dialog need Win32, and those
 * live in spdf_win_menu.cpp.
 *
 * THE GROUPING AND THE TITLES ARE macOS'S, transcribed from
 * portable/mac/ShenzhenPDFMac.mm:2133-2424 -- File, Go To, Zoom, View, Edit, in
 * that order and with those item titles -- minus the commands this port does not
 * have yet. Nothing here is invented: an item exists only if the command behind
 * it exists.
 *
 * THE ACCELERATORS ARE Cmd -> Ctrl, which is the mapping the GTK4 frontend
 * already made once (spdf_shortcuts.c:2). Where macOS uses Option (its page
 * navigation: Option+arrows) the Windows spelling is Alt, which is the same
 * physical key in the same role. Three deliberate departures from a literal
 * transcription, each one following GTK4's existing choice rather than inventing
 * a third answer:
 *
 *   - 100% is Ctrl+0, not Ctrl+4 (macOS's Cmd+4). GTK4: win.zoom-actual.
 *   - Previous/Next Tab are Ctrl+PageUp / Ctrl+PageDown, not Ctrl+Left/Right,
 *     which on Windows are word-motion keys. GTK4: win.prev-tab / win.next-tab.
 *     Ctrl+Tab and Ctrl+Shift+Tab keep working as they already did.
 *   - Toggle Side Panel is F9. GTK4: win.sidebar. macOS binds no key.
 *
 * ONE BEHAVIOUR CHANGE THIS TABLE MAKES ON PURPOSE. The Windows keymap had
 * Ctrl+1 = Fit Width and Ctrl+2 = Fit Page, which is neither macOS's order
 * (Cmd+1 Fit Page, Cmd+2 Fit Width, Cmd+3 Fit Height) nor GTK4's (identical to
 * macOS). It is now macOS's, because a menu that PRINTS an accelerator makes the
 * disagreement visible and a reader who uses two of the three frontends would
 * hit it immediately.

/* THE WHOLE MENU AS A POPUP, hung off the toolbar's `...` button.
 *
 * WHY THE APP HAS NO MENU BAR. macOS's menus live in the SYSTEM menu bar at the
 * top of the screen -- they are not part of the window at all -- so an in-window
 * menu strip is a bar macOS does not have, and it showed: dark caption, then a
 * white Win32 menu strip, then dark chrome, reported from actual use as "a
 * double top bar like it's a window inside of a window".
 *
 * It cannot be fixed by theming. SetPreferredAppMode(AllowDark) darkens POPUP
 * menus but not the menu BAR, which the frame draws; making that dark means
 * owner-drawing the strip and taking over its measurement, keyboard navigation
 * and accessibility. Measured here, not assumed: with dark mode on and the
 * system set to dark, the bar stayed white.
 *
 * So the bar is gone and the same table is shown from the `...` overflow the
 * toolbar already had -- which is also what every modern Windows app of this
 * shape does (Edge, VS Code, Explorer all dropped the menu bar for an overflow),
 * and the button was already drawn and inert. Nothing is lost: every command
 * keeps its accelerator, because the keymap resolves those itself and never
 * depended on the bar (spdf_win_chrome_commands.h).
 *
 * Returns the chosen spdf_win_command, or SPDF_WIN_CMD_NONE. Takes the same
 * state the bar took, so ticks and greying are identical -- including that Print
 * greys on the document's own print flag while the Copy Page items never do.
 * Modal, like the tab overflow beside it. */
