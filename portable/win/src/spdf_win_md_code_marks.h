/* spdf_win_md_code_marks.h -- routing a canvas click to a code box's controls.
 *
 * The sibling of spdf_win_annot_marks.h and deliberately the same shape: pure,
 * header-only, no app state and no document. The marks arrive already in CLIENT
 * DEVICE PIXELS, published by the paint that drew the pills
 * (spdf_win_md_code.h), so a pill is hit exactly where it was drawn -- which is
 * spdf_win_chrome.h's rule that painting and hit-testing agree only when they
 * use the same rectangles, obeyed by making them literally the same numbers.
 *
 * THE ORDER, and why. Inside the canvas the code controls are tested FIRST,
 * before a comment badge and before the canvas asks whether the point is over
 * text. That is the mac's precedence (SPDFMacMarkdownPageCanvas.mm:340-360 tries
 * the copy button, then the language control, then characterIndexAtPoint), and
 * it is what stops a click on a pill from starting a text selection: the router
 * returns an action that is not SPDF_WIN_CA_CANVAS, so canvas_press is never
 * called for it. Within the row the copy button wins over the language pill,
 * because their hit rectangles both carry 7px of slop and could overlap on a
 * narrow column -- and the copy button is the one that cannot be reached any
 * other way (the picker also has a menu row).
 *
 * The comparisons are inclusive, as in spdf_win_annot_marks.h, and the marks
 * carry their slop already.
 *
 * Included by spdf_win_chrome_input.h only, after the action enum and the hit
 * struct it fills are complete.
