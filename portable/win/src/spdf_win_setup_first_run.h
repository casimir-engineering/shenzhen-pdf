/* spdf_win_setup_first_run.h — whether the first launch asks anything, and what
 * the answer means.
 *
 * Pure, and included by spdf_win_setup.h (after SPDF_WIN_SETUP_INLINE), which is
 * where the Win32 half, spdf_win_setup_first_run(), is declared. Its own file
 * because spdf_win_setup.h reached the 500-line cap tools/file-size-limits.md
 * asks not to raise — and because this really is a separate concern from the
 * install: the install is "what happens", this is "may we even ask". Getting the
 * second one wrong does not produce a wrong install. It produces a test run that
 * hangs on a modal dialog.
 *
 * A downloaded exe that just opens a window leaves the person who downloaded it
 * with no idea that installing is even possible, and an exe that installs itself
 * without asking is spyware manners. So the FIRST launch asks, once, with three
 * choices, and then never asks again.
 *
 * THE GATE IS THE DANGEROUS PART AND IS WHY IT IS PURE. A modal dialog shown on
 * a launch the test harness drives does not fail — it HANGS, and takes the whole
 * run with it. portable/win/verify-phase1.ps1, measure-launch.ps1 and
 * drive-window.ps1 each start a real windowed app with a fresh temp --state-dir,
 * and a fresh state directory is indistinguishable from "never asked": without
 * the --state-dir arm every one of them would sit at this dialog forever. So
 * every condition is an argument, the truth table is
 * portable/win/tests/setup_test.c's — all 64 combinations — and nothing about it
 * depends on a machine.
