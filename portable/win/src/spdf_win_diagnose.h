/* spdf_win_diagnose.h — `ShenzhenPDF.exe --diagnose`: what every running copy of
 * this app looks like from outside, plus what the running copies wrote down
 * about themselves.
 *
 * WHY A SWITCH AND NOT A SCRIPT. The report this exists for -- "the app was
 * never responsive to any user input and not even focusable" -- arrives while
 * the bad window is still on screen, from a person who has a terminal and no
 * PowerShell probe checked out. `ShenzhenPDF.exe --diagnose` is one line they
 * can type and one block they can paste, and it needs no build, no repo and no
 * second tool. portable/win/measure-launch.ps1 and the launch.health case
 * measure the same things and prove more; they are for the harness, and this is
 * for the moment.
 *
 * WHAT IT CAN AND CANNOT SEE. Every window of class ShenzhenPDFWindow on the
 * desktop, whatever process owns it, is measured with the same line builder the
 * app's own launch-health.log uses (spdf_win_health.h) -- foreground, enabled,
 * visible, iconic, rect, monitor, on-screen, z-index, and IsHungAppWindow across
 * that process's windows. The in-process half of the line (the input counters,
 * the paint total, the UI heartbeat) belongs to the process that owns the
 * window, so it prints as `-` here and is read instead from that process's own
 * launch-health.log, which is dumped underneath.
 *
 * Header-only and included from spdf_win_main.cpp alone, like spdf_win_usage.h
 * and spdf_win_headless.h. Always exits 0: a diagnostic that can fail is a
 * diagnostic nobody trusts when it says nothing.
