#include "spdf_win_tabs_drag.h"
/* Performing what spdf_win_chrome_input.h decided.
 *
 * Internal to the Windows frontend and header-only, like spdf_win_tabs_app.h and
 * spdf_win_headless_viewport.h beside it, and for the same two reasons those give:
 * it depends on `struct app`, so it must be included from spdf_win_main.cpp after
 * that struct; and spdf_win_main.cpp is at its 500-line cap, where
 * tools/file-size-limits.md asks for an extracted file rather than a raised one.
 *
 * THE THREE-LAYER SPLIT, and why the middle layer exists at all:
 *
 *   spdf_win_window.cpp   translates Win32 messages. Owns the HWND, the capture
 *                         and the cursor. Knows no document and no chrome.
 *   spdf_win_chrome_input.h  decides what a point MEANS. Pure, testable, knows
 *                         no app.
 *   this file             does it. Knows both, and is the only file that does.
 *
 * Its paint-time other half -- chrome_inputs_for(), chrome_scroll_into() and
 * scene_for_window() -- is in spdf_win_chrome_scene.h, which spdf_win_main.cpp
 * includes just before this one. Two of those are called from here; see that
 * file's header for where the seam is and why it falls there.
 *
 * That is the same shape spdf_win_window.h already imposed on the keyboard --
 * "the caller owns the keymap: which key means 'next page' is product policy,
 * not window plumbing" -- extended to the mouse, which is now a device that can
 * land on eight different things.
 *
 * TWO INVARIANTS THIS FILE EXISTS TO HOLD.
 *
 * 1. The chrome is laid out here with the SAME function and the SAME inputs the
 *    painter used, so a click lands on the rect that was drawn. Not a cached
 *    layout from the last paint: a cache is stale for exactly one event after a
 *    resize, and a divider that resizes the wrong panel for one frame is the kind
 *    of bug that gets blamed on the divider.
 *
 * 2. Canvas coordinates are CANVAS-LOCAL. The canvas is laid out against
 *    chrome_layout.canvas.w/h, so every canvas API -- and above all
 *    spdf_win_canvas_zoom_at()'s anchor -- has its origin at the canvas's own
 *    corner. Before the chrome existed that corner was the window's, and the
 *    window passed client coordinates straight through; with the sidebar open
 *    they are 245 px apart, and a Ctrl+wheel zoom fed the un-translated point
 *    anchors on a document point that is not under the cursor. Every conversion
 *    here goes through spdf_win_chrome_input_canvas_x/y() so there is one place
 *    to be wrong.
 */

/* The scroller's hover/press state, pushed to the painter and reported as
 * "changed" so a hover can decide whether it is worth a repaint. Normalised
 * BEFORE the comparison, because spdf_win_chrome_scroll_set_hot() normalises
 * anything that is not a scroller to NONE -- comparing the raw part against the
 * stored one would then report a change on every pointer move over the canvas
 * and repaint the window continuously. */
