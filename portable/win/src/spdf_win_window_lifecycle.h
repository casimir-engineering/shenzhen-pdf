/* The window's LIFECYCLE -- register the class, create it, show it, tick it,
 * run the message loop, destroy it -- for spdf_win_window.cpp only.
 *
 * Same arrangement as spdf_win_window_target.h, _input.h, _caption.h, _frame.h
 * and _tooltip.h beside it: header-only, included from exactly one translation
 * unit, and not part of the port's public surface. It sits at the BOTTOM of
 * that file rather than beside the others because it depends on window_proc()
 * -- RegisterClassExW needs the procedure, and the procedure needs every
 * handler above it.
 *
 * It moved out when the deferred-launch one-shot (spdf_win_window_set_once)
 * took spdf_win_window.cpp past the 500-line cap; tools/file-size-limits.md
 * asks for an extracted file rather than a raised one, and this is the seam
 * that was already implicit in the file -- everything above is what a window
 * DOES with a message, and everything here is how one comes to exist and stop
 * existing.
 *
 * THE THREE TIMERS ARE ALL SET HERE (the ids are next to `struct
 * spdf_win_window`): the periodic tick, the one-shot, and the tooltip's delay,
 * which spdf_win_window_tooltip.h arms. WM_TIMER routes all three in
 * window_proc.

     * ShowWindow maps the window; it does not decide who is in front.
     * Ordinarily that does not matter, because Windows hands a newly launched
     * process the right to take the foreground and the first window it shows
     * takes it. But that grant is not open-ended: it lapses when the launching
     * application's input goes elsewhere, and this app now does real work --
     * open the document, build the scene, render and present the first frame,
     * about 145 ms of it -- BEFORE it shows anything, precisely so the window
     * appears complete rather than blank. By the time ShowWindow runs, the
     * window that launched us can easily have the foreground back, and the app
     * then appears BEHIND it, unfocused, with only a sliver visible. Reported
     * as "I can't interact with it at all, not even focus it with alt tab" --
     * from a maximized window, that sliver is all there is to click.
     *
     * So the window asks, the way any application does after showing its main
     * window. SetForegroundWindow may still refuse -- the foreground lock is
     * the system's to enforce and another app may legitimately own it -- and
     * refusing is not an error worth reporting: FlashWindowEx then does what
     * Windows itself does in that case and marks the taskbar button, so the
     * reader can see where the window went. BringWindowToTop covers the case
     * where activation is granted without a raise (a foreground window sitting
     * below another in the z-order is a state this has actually been observed
