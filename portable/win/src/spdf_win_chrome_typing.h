/* spdf_win_chrome_typing.h -- THE THREE TYPEABLE FIELDS: which buffer the
 * keyboard is talking to, one typed code unit, and a key while a field has the
 * keyboard.
 *
 * Split out of spdf_win_chrome_commands.h when the wiring pass brought that
 * file to its 500-line cap (tools/file-size-limits.md asks for an extracted
 * file rather than a raised one). The seam is the one that header's own
 * comment draws: step 2 of key_for_window() -- "THE FOCUSED FIELD, if there is
 * one" -- is this file whole, and nothing here knows a command exists. What is
 * left next door is the keymap, the command switch and the menu sync.
 *
 * Header-only and included from spdf_win_chrome_commands.h only, after
 * `struct app`, spdf_win_chrome_scene.h and spdf_win_chrome_field_ui.h (it
 * calls chrome_find_push, chrome_find_step and spdf_win_chrome_content_set_filter).
 * Not part of the port's public surface.
