/* COMMAND HANDLERS: windows, presentation and full screen, sessions and settings.
 *
 * Header-only, included from spdf_win_chrome_commands.h only, after the app
 * struct, the chrome model and the input types are complete -- the same
 * arrangement as every other *_commands/*_actions header in this port. Owned
 * by the parity track of that name (portable/docs/windows-feature-matrix.md);
 * the other tracks have their own and none of them edits command_perform().
 *
 * Return 1 when the command was consumed, 0 to let it fall through.
 *
 * WHAT IS CLAIMED HERE AND WHY. Presentation (F5) and Full Screen (F11) are
 * this track's own. New Window and Move Tab to New Window are the multi-window
 * half: one process per window, the session file as the hand-over
 * (spdf_win_session_detach_tab). Keep Image Colors is the setting the View
 * menu already ticks from SPDF_RENDER_PRESERVE_IMAGES. Print is claimed too,
 * ahead of command_perform()'s own case, because the scaling choice (Fit /
 * Actual Size / Custom) lives in settings.yaml and the switch next door passes
 * a hard-coded default; claiming it here is how the choice reaches the job and
 * persists without editing that file. Close Other Tabs is claimed for the
 * plainest reason: nothing claimed it, so the menu row did nothing at all.

 * writes session.yaml on every call, so routing twenty tabs through it would
 * throw the kept document's page cache away twenty times and hit the disk
 * twenty times to reach the same end state. The two things it does that MUST
 * happen per tab -- note the path for Reopen Last Closed Tab, and release the
 * watch and any shadow copy while the model still has the path -- are done per

 *

 * anything: it is being told that a tab is over its bar, that it no longer is,
 * or that it has been let go there.
 *
 * WHERE THE POINTER IS, ASKED OF WINDOWS. The messages carry no coordinates --
 * SPDF_WIN_INPUT_COMMAND has none to carry -- so the position comes from
 * GetCursorPos at the moment the message is handled. That is not a compromise:
 * the indicator has to be drawn where the pointer is when the frame appears,
 * and a position stamped a few milliseconds earlier by the other process would
 * be the wrong one to draw.
 *
 * THE INDICATOR IS THE REORDER DRAG'S. a->drag_tab and a->drop_slot are what
 * spdf_win_chrome_paint.cpp reads for the yellow line; setting both here draws
 * exactly the line a local reorder draws, at the gap the drop will use, with no
 * second field and no painter change. drag_tab is only a "there is a drag" flag
 * to the painter -- nothing else reads it -- and every existing path that ends
 * a gesture already clears both. */
