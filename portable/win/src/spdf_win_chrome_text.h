/* spdf_win_chrome_text.h — the three typeable fields, as arithmetic.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS: a caret and a fixed UTF-16 buffer, and the seven edits a
 * single-line field supports. Pure, toolkit-free, header-only, no state, no
 * allocation -- the same shape as spdf_win_chrome.h, spdf_win_tabstrip.h and
 * spdf_win_chrome_toolbar.h, and testable the same way
 * (portable/win/tests/chrome_text_test.c).
 *
 * WHY NOT AN EDIT CONTROL. A real child HWND in the toolbar would bring its own
 * font, its own colours, its own focus ring and its own DPI behaviour, none of
 * which match the Direct2D chrome drawn around it -- and it would put a piece of
 * the window outside spdf_win_paint(), which is the one thing this port's whole
 * verification strategy depends on staying whole (spdf_win_d2d.h: the compose
 * path must never require an HWND). The fields are already DRAWN by the chrome
 * painters; what was missing was somewhere for the characters to go. This is
 * that, and it costs no window and no toolkit.
 *
 * WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT HAVE: selection, undo, and mouse-positioned
 * carets. A find field and a page field are three to twelve characters long and
 * every one of those features needs a text-metric pass (where IS the caret, in
 * pixels?) that would drag DirectWrite into this header and out of every test
 * that can run without a device. Ctrl+A is therefore "select all" only in the
 * sense that clears the field, and the caret moves by key. Named here so the
 * absence is a decision rather than an oversight.
 *
 * SURROGATE PAIRS. WM_CHAR delivers one UTF-16 code unit per message, so an
 * astral character arrives as two calls to spdf_win_text_insert(). Inserting
 * them one at a time is correct because the caret only ever moves over units
 * that are already in the buffer; what would NOT be correct is a backspace that
 * removes one unit of a pair, so spdf_win_text_backspace() removes both. Nothing
 * else in this file has to know surrogates exist.
