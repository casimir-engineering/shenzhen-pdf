/* The continuous scrolling canvas. See spdf_win_canvas.h for the layering.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE IS STUBBED, which is worth saying because an earlier draft of
 * this file was. All three seams are the real thing:
 *
 *  - GEOMETRY IS REAL. Every slot rect, fit zoom, zoom anchor and horizontal
 *    clamp below comes from T3's spdf_win_layout.h, which is the de-glib'd
 *    port of the shipping GTK4 header. Nothing here re-derives layout maths,
 *    which is the point: the provenance comments in that header record which
 *    shipped bug each formulation fixes.
 *  - THE CACHE IS REAL. T3's spdf_win_lru holds decoded pages under the 96 MB
 *    budget with the same LRU policy the other two frontends use.
 *  - THE WORKER POOL IS REAL. T5's spdf_win_render service prefetches the
 *    pages either side of the viewport off-thread.
 *
 * THE VISIBLE PAGE CAN NOW RENDER OFF-THREAD TOO, and the three conditions on
 * that are the whole design. The asymmetry this header used to defend --
 * on-screen pages rendered SYNCHRONOUSLY in ensure_page() even though a worker
 * pool was right there -- rested on two claims that are both still true, so
 * neither is given up:
 *
 *   - the canvas must never hand back a frame with a HOLE in it, so the
 *     placeholder path in the compose layer stays a safety net rather than
 *     something a reader sees on every page break;
 *   - and the headless viewport probe must stay DETERMINISTIC. A
 *     --render-window-png whose pixels depended on whether a worker had
 *     finished yet would be a PNG no comparison against macOS could trust, and
 *     that comparison is the only evidence this port is correct.
 *
 * So the async path is guarded three ways and the guards are what let it exist:
 *
 *   1. OPT-IN. Nothing is asynchronous until a shell calls
 *      spdf_win_canvas_set_async_visible(), which the headless paths never do.
 *      Every --render-window-png frame and every d2d.compose case is therefore
 *      pixel-for-pixel what it was, by construction rather than by measurement.
 *   2. NEVER THE FIRST FRAME. frames_built gates it, so the frame a launch
 *      paints before ShowWindow (spdf_win_window_lifecycle.h) is rendered here,
 *      complete, exactly as before. Launch measures the synchronous page render
 *      finishing 45 ms BEFORE the GPU device is ready
 *      (windows-launch-performance.md §8), so that render costs the launch
 *      nothing at all: it is spent inside a wait that existed anyway, and
 *      moving it off-thread could only trade a complete first window for a
 *      blank one.
 *   3. NEVER WITHOUT A STAND-IN. When the exact key misses, the async path asks
 *      the pool at VISIBLE priority and then draws this same page at the
 *      nearest zoom the cache does hold (spdf_win_lru_lookup_nearest_zoom) --
 *      right content, right aspect, one resolution behind, stretched over its
 *      slot by the machinery that already stretches byte-capped textures. If
 *      the cache holds nothing at all for that page, it renders here after all.
 *      A soft page for a frame or two is the honest cost; a hole is not.
 *
 * What the pool buys for the NEIGHBOURS is unchanged and is still the bigger
 * half: the page you are about to reach is ready before you get there. What it
 * buys for the visible page is that a zoom step, a jump to a match or a
 * restored page does not stop the UI thread for the length of a MuPDF render.
