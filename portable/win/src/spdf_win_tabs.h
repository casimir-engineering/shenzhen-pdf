/* spdf_win_tabs.h — several documents open at once, one of them showing.
 *
 * IT OWNS NO WIN32 AND NO DIRECT2D, and it does not include spdf_win_canvas.h
 * either. That is the same discipline spdf_win_canvas.h states for itself, for
 * the same reason: the interesting behaviour here is policy — which tab gets
 * selected when you close the one you are looking at, what a restored session
 * costs before you touch it — and policy that can only be exercised through an
 * HWND is policy nobody can test. Everything below runs headlessly, which is
 * why portable/win/tests/tabs_test.c is a plain C program.
 *
 * A tab is a PATH plus the view state that belongs to that path (page, zoom,
 * fit mode, scroll offset) plus, once somebody actually looks at it, a
 * document. The document is deliberately an opaque `void*` supplied by a
 * caller-provided hook rather than a spdf_document*: it keeps this file free of
 * the core and of MuPDF, and it is what lets the lazy-restore test count
 * materialisations without opening a single PDF.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * LAZY BY CONTRACT
 *
 * Restoring N tabs must not open or render N documents. Startup time is the
 * product's headline promise and it is the one thing a session feature can
 * quietly destroy: fifteen restored tabs that each open a document at launch
 * turn a 200 ms start into several seconds, and the user paid that for
 * fourteen documents they were not looking at.
 *
 * So NOTHING here opens a document as a side effect of existing. Exactly two
 * calls can invoke the open hook — spdf_win_tabs_document() and
 * spdf_win_tabs_select() — and spdf_win_session_restore() calls neither. The
 * deferred form, spdf_win_tabs_select_deferred(), moves the selection without
 * materialising anything, so a frontend can restore the persisted selection at
 * launch and let the first paint decide when to pay for it.
 * spdf_win_tabs_materialize_count() exists purely so a test can assert the
 * number of documents opened is the number the reader asked for.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE CLOSE POLICY IS THE MAC APP'S, NOT AN INVENTED ONE
 *
 * Ported from portable/mac/SPDFMacTabLifecycle.{h,mm} and its call sites in
 * ShenzhenPDFMac.mm, so the two frontends feel the same:
 *
 *   - Every selection is recorded in an activation history, most recent first,
 *     keyed on tab IDENTITY. Identity, not path or index, because tabs get
 *     reordered and two tabs may hold the same path; a history keyed on either
 *     would restore the wrong tab. (SPDFMacTabLifecycle compares with `==` on
 *     the object; here it is the stable per-tab pointer.)
 *   - Closing a tab that is NOT selected leaves the selection on the same TAB
 *     (its index shifts down when the closed tab was to its left) —
 *     ShenzhenPDFMac.mm:9140.
 *   - Closing the SELECTED tab picks a replacement. Ctrl+W and the close box
 *     ask for the DETERMINISTIC ADJACENT tab — the one to the right, or the one
 *     to the left when the closed tab was last (ShenzhenPDFMac.mm:9115 passes
 *     preferMostRecentActive:NO). Detaching a tab into its own window asks for
 *     the most recently active survivor instead (:9300). Hence the
 *     prefer_most_recent_active argument rather than one hard-coded rule.
 *   - MRU falls back to adjacent when history holds no survivor.
 *   - Closing the last tab leaves the selection at -1. What a frontend does
 *     then is its own business: the mac app closes the window when another
 *     ShenzhenPDF window exists and otherwise shows "Open a document".
