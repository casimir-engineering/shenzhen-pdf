/* spdf_win_settings.h — the reader's preferences, across launches: settings.yaml.
 *
 * THE SAME FILE THE OTHER TWO FRONTENDS WRITE, key for key. The schema is the
 * mac app's (ShenzhenPDFMac.mm:1155-1210 reads it, :1786-1813 writes it) as the
 * GTK4 frontend already transcribed it (portable/linux/gtk4/spdf_state_internal.h:61-95,
 * spdf_state.c parse_settings / settings_to_json), through the same codec
 * (portable/core/spdf_yaml.c) and the same file shell (spdf_win_state.h) the
 * session already uses. THERE IS NO WINDOWS SERIALIZER HERE, exactly as
 * spdf_win_session.h says of itself; what this file adds is the shape of one
 * document -- which keys mean what, their defaults and their clamps -- and it
 * takes every one of them from the two shipping frontends:
 *
 *   fitMode 0..4, zoom, sidebarWidth, minimapWidth,
 *   defaultSidebarVisibleForNewDocuments, defaultMinimapVisibleForNewDocuments,
 *   searchJumpsToNearestResult, preventSleepInPresentation,
 *   printScalingMode 0..2, printCustomScale, windowSize {width, height},
 *   markdownTheme "light"|"dark", darkThemePreservesImages, commentAuthor.
 *
 * "markdownTheme" IS THE READING THEME FOR EVERY DOCUMENT, and it keeps that
 * name deliberately: SPDFMacReadingThemeIntegration.mm:18 -- "users who had
 * chosen it for Markdown keep their choice". A Windows build that wrote
 * "theme" instead would leave a mac user's dark theme behind on every
 * round trip, so the misnomer is the format.
 *
 * ONE DEPARTURE, AND IT IS ABOUT ABSENCE. The mac app reads a missing
 * markdownTheme as light; a Windows window FOLLOWS THE SYSTEM THEME until told
 * otherwise (spdf_win_system_prefers_dark, from actual use: "it does not respect
 * the system theme"). So the key is tri-state here -- absent means "the
 * system's" and is written back as absent -- and it becomes "light" or "dark"
 * the first time the reader toggles the theme, which is the moment they have
 * expressed a preference. A file the mac app wrote is read exactly as the mac
 * app reads it.
 *
 * WHAT IT REFUSES TO DO, inherited from spdf_win_session.h:
 *
 *   1. It never drops a key it does not model. The mac app's
 *      fullDiskAccessPromptDismissed, permissionsWizardShown,
 *      translate*Language, the GTK app's ocrLanguage and instantLaunchResident
 *      -- all carried through a save byte for byte, so opening a shared
 *      settings.yaml on Windows and quitting re-triggers no mac prompt and
 *      forgets no Linux choice.
 *   2. It never writes over a file it could not read. SPDF_WIN_SETTINGS_UNREADABLE
 *      on load means the defaults are in force for this run and a save writes
 *      NOTHING (spdf_win_state.h's "SILENT FAILURE IF WRONG").
 *
 * PURE HALVES FOR THE TEST. spdf_win_settings_parse_json() and
 * spdf_win_settings_to_json() take and return JSON text with no file behind
 * them, so portable/win/tests/settings_test.c pins the clamps and the
 * carry-through without a state directory; the load/save pair is the file shell
 * around them.
 *
 * FOR THE OTHER TRACKS: spdf_win_settings_shared() is the process-wide copy,
 * loaded on first use. Read a key from it
 * (`spdf_win_settings_shared()->search_jumps_to_nearest_result`); to change
 * one, write the field and call spdf_win_settings_commit().
