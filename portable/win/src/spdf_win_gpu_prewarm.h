/* spdf_win_gpu_prewarm.h — create Direct2D's GPU device early, on a worker.
 *
 * THE COST THIS HIDES. The window's first WM_PAINT creates the
 * ID2D1HwndRenderTarget, and the first hardware render target a Direct2D
 * factory makes creates the factory's D3D device -- which maps and initialises
 * dxgi.dll, d3d11.dll and the vendor's user-mode driver. Measured with the
 * SPDF-LAUNCH timeline (portable/docs/windows-launch-performance.md): 80-117 ms
 * on this machine, the single largest item between process creation and the
 * first page, and it ran AFTER the window was already visible, so the reader
 * saw an empty frame for that long. Nothing before the first paint needs the
 * GPU, and nothing in session restore, spdf_open, page-0 measurement or
 * CreateWindowExW needs more than one core, so the two overlap here.
 *
 * HOW. Measured with the two probes recorded in the doc: a D3D11 device made
 * on a worker does NOT help -- Direct2D 1.0 still creates its own device for
 * its first hardware target (a second device on this driver costs 50-90 ms
 * even with the driver resident). But a factory shares its internal device
 * between ALL its hardware render targets, and with a MULTI_THREADED factory
 * that holds across threads: after a worker has created a throwaway
 * HwndRenderTarget on a hidden window of its own, the UI thread's real target
 * costs 0.4-0.5 ms instead of ~80. The real target is still created exactly as
 * before, on the UI thread, through the same call with the same properties, on
 * the same kind of device; only WHEN the device is created has moved. The first
 * frame's pixels are unchanged, which the d2d.compose-* cases pin.
 *
 * The dummy target is KEPT until finish(): releasing the last hardware target
 * lets the factory drop the device, which would be the same cost paid twice.
 * Its window belongs to the worker thread (DestroyWindow must run there), so
 * the thread parks on an event until finish() and tears both down itself.
 *
 *   start(d2d): windowed path only, right after spdf_win_d2d_create(). The
 *          headless PNG paths must NOT call it: they draw through a software
 *          WIC target and would only wait for a driver load at exit.
 *   finish(): joins the worker; called from spdf_win_d2d_destroy() BEFORE the
 *          factory is released; a no-op when start() was never called.
 *
 * HEADER-ONLY, like spdf_win_launch_profile.h and for the same reason: every
 * test that links spdf_win_d2d.cpp lists its translation units by hand, and a
 * new .cpp would have to be added to each of those lists or the link fails.
 * The state is one __declspec(selectany) object shared by every TU; the
 * functions are static. Only C++ TUs get the implementation (it drives COM
 * vtables); a C TU that includes spdf_win_d2d.h sees the declarations alone
 * and never calls them. */
