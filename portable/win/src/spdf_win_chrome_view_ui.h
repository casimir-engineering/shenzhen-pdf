/* spdf_win_chrome_view_ui.h -- what a gesture or a key does to the VIEW of the
 * document: the router's layout, zoom in/out/at, page step, the fit cycle, the
 * reading theme, a trough click, and the canvas rebuild they share.
 *
 * Split out of spdf_win_chrome_actions.h when the wiring pass brought that
 * file to its 500-line cap (tools/file-size-limits.md asks for an extracted
 * file rather than a raised one). The seam is the one the three-layer note in
 * that header already draws: this file changes the one document the reader is
 * looking at, while what is left next door decides which handler a point
 * reaches and runs the gestures (chrome_perform, chrome_mouse). Every function
 * here is called from both the mouse router and the keymap
 * (spdf_win_chrome_commands.h), which is why they were never inside either.
 *
 * Header-only and included from spdf_win_chrome_actions.h only, after
 * `struct app`, spdf_win_chrome_scene.h (chrome_scroll_into) and
 * spdf_win_session_app.h (show_selected_tab). Not part of the port's public
 * surface.
