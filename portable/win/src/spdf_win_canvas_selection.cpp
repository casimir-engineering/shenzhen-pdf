/* The canvas's pointer gesture: text selection, the cursor, and following a
 * link. See spdf_win_canvas.h's "text selection and links" section for the
 * public surface and spdf_win_canvas_internal.h for why the state lives on the
 * canvas.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A THIRD CANVAS TRANSLATION UNIT rather than more of
 * spdf_win_canvas.cpp: that file is at 475 of the repo's 500 lines and the rule
 * is extraction over cap bumps (tools/file-size-limits.md). The seam is the
 * same one spdf_win_canvas_prefetch.cpp took -- one subject, one file, one
 * shared private header.
 *
 * THE PAGE LIST IS THE LAST BUILT FRAME'S, and that is on purpose rather than a
 * shortcut. `canvas->draws` is exactly what the reader is looking at when they
 * click, in exactly the coordinates the click arrives in, so a hit test against
 * it cannot disagree with what was drawn -- not at a fractional zoom, not on a
 * byte-capped foldout whose texture is smaller than its slot, and not on a
 * frame where a page was still being measured. Deriving the geometry a second
 * time from the layout would be a second chance to be wrong. The cost is that a
 * click before the first paint selects nothing, which is a click at a moment
 * when there is nothing on screen to select.
 *
 * `canvas->measured` -- NOT `canvas->page_count` -- is passed as the page-size
 * count everywhere below, so a page whose size is still page 1's estimate
 * resolves to no hit rather than to a wrong PDF point. build_scene() measures
 * forward until the visible range stops moving, so every page in `draws` is
 * already measured and the guard never fires in practice; it fires only if that
 * invariant is ever broken, which is exactly when a silent wrong answer would
 * be worst.
