/* spdf_win_health.h — WHAT STATE IS THIS WINDOW ACTUALLY IN, written down by
 * the app itself.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS. "The app was never responsive to any user input and not even
 * focusable", launched from dist\ShenzhenPDF-win-x64.exe. Nobody has been able
 * to reproduce it: launched again from a shell or from Explorer on the same
 * machine the window comes up foreground, enabled, not hung, answering WM_NULL,
 * and repainting under SendInput. Windows Error Reporting recorded no hang.
 * Every instrument this port has -- the headless compose, the PrintWindow
 * sampler, measure-launch.ps1's external health block -- can only measure a
 * launch someone is standing over. The one witness that is present EVERY time
 * is the process itself, and until this header it wrote nothing down.
 *
 * So it writes. Three lines per windowed launch (1 s, 5 s and 30 s after the
 * window is shown) into <state dir>\launch-health.log, plus a `stall` line from
 * a watchdog thread whenever the UI thread's heartbeat goes stale -- see
 * spdf_win_health_log.h for the timers, the file and the watchdog. This header
 * is the MEASUREMENT half: the counters the window proc bumps, the heartbeat the
 * message loop stamps, and the one function that turns all of it plus a live
 * HWND into one greppable line.
 *
 * THE LINE IS MEASURED FROM TWO SIDES, and the split matters. Everything from
 * `fg=` onwards is asked of user32 about an HWND and needs no cooperation from
 * the thread that owns it -- GetForegroundWindow, IsWindowEnabled,
 * IsWindowVisible, IsIconic, GetWindowRect, MonitorFromWindow, the z-order walk
 * and IsHungAppWindow are all answered from the desktop's own state. NOTHING
 * HERE MAY SEND A MESSAGE (no GetWindowTextW, no SendMessage, no
 * GetWindowInfo-by-proxy): the watchdog calls this function precisely when the
 * UI thread has stopped pumping, and a send would then block the one thread
 * that is still able to report. The counters and the heartbeat are the other
 * side: they are in-process facts, and a --diagnose looking at ANOTHER process's
 * window prints `-` for them rather than guessing.
 *
 * ZERO COST WHEN NOTHING IS WRONG. The window proc's call is one switch and one
 * InterlockedIncrement on the messages that count and an immediate return on
 * every other; the message loop's heartbeat is one GetTickCount64 (a read of
 * KUSER_SHARED_DATA, no syscall) and one aligned 64-bit store. Nothing is
 * allocated and nothing is formatted until a line is due.
 *
 * HEADER-ONLY, ONE SHARED STATE, MANY TRANSLATION UNITS -- the same arrangement
 * spdf_win_launch_profile.h uses next door, and for the same reason: the
 * counters are bumped in spdf_win_window.cpp, the line is written from
 * spdf_win_launch_window.h and read again by --diagnose in spdf_win_main.cpp,
 * and none of those should have to route through a new .cpp and a new export.
 * MSVC only, like everything under portable/win/src.
