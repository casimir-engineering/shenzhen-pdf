/* spdf_win_about.h — About Shenzhen PDF, and the app's identity on the taskbar.
 *
 * ABOUT (SPDF_WIN_CMD_ABOUT): the version and build from
 * spdf_win_about_version.h -- the same constants the exe's VERSIONINFO and the
 * updater read, so the box can never disagree with either -- the rendering
 * core's version (MuPDF's FZ_VERSION, the one component version the core
 * exposes), the Windows build it runs on, and the icon out of the exe's own
 * resources. The text is built by a pure function so about_test.c can pin it
 * without a window.
 *
 * IDENTITY: spdf_win_about_apply_identity() sets the process's
 * AppUserModelID (so every ShenzhenPDF window groups under one taskbar button
 * with one icon, and a pinned shortcut is recognised as this app) and hands the
 * window its big and small icons from the resource (the title bar and Alt+Tab
 * take the window's icon, not the exe's). Called once, after the window
 * exists; it reads two resources and writes nothing to disk or registry.
