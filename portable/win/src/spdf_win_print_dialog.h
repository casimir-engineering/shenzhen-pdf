/* spdf_win_print_dialog.h — the two ways this port asks "print what, where?".
 *
 * WINDOWS' OWN DIALOG IS STILL THE NORMAL PATH, but it is no longer allowed to
 * take the app with it. spdf_win_print_system_dialog() calls PrintDlgExW on a
 * DEDICATED THREAD with its own STA and its own message pump, and watches for a
 * window: if nothing of ours becomes visible within
 * SPDF_WIN_PRINT_DIALOG_WATCHDOG_MS the wait is over, the thread is ABANDONED
 * (never TerminateThread -- see below), and the caller falls back to the
 * in-app dialog in this same header.
 *
 * WHAT WAS MEASURED, on this host (Windows 11 Pro 26200, 2026-09-04), by
 * portable/win/tests/print_dialog_probe.c. The full transcript and the sweep
 * that produced it are portable/docs/windows-print-dialog.md:
 *
 *   PrintDlgExW, hwndOwner = NULL       returns E_HANDLE (0x80070006) at once
 *   PrintDlgExW, a valid hwndOwner      NEVER RETURNS, and creates no window
 *   PrintDlgW  PD_RETURNDC              works: shows "Print", returns TRUE with
 *                                       a 600 dpi printer DC on OK, FALSE on
 *                                       Cancel
 *   PrintDlgW  PD_RETURNDEFAULT         works (no UI, ok=1)
 *   PrintDlgW  PD_PRINTSETUP            works: shows "Print Setup"
 *   PageSetupDlgW                       works: shows "Page Setup"
 *   DocumentPropertiesW DM_IN_PROMPT    works: shows the driver's own sheet
 *
 * So comdlg32 is fine here and only PrintDlgExW is broken -- which corrects the
 * earlier note in spdf_win_print.h that "no comdlg32 print dialog can be shown
 * on this machine". The hang survives every app-level variable worth trying:
 * the worker's apartment (STA, MTA, none), whether it pumps, DPI awareness,
 * the Common Controls 6 activation context the app has and the probe does not,
 * dropping PD_RETURNDC, and having no property page at all. It is not this
 * app's call; it is the hand-off to the Windows 11 print experience.
 *
 * WHY hwndOwner IS CHECKED BEFORE A THREAD IS EVEN STARTED. PRINTDLGEX's
 * hwndOwner "must be a valid window handle; it cannot be NULL", and this host
 * enforces that with E_HANDLE. A NULL parent therefore goes straight to the
 * fallback instead of paying the watchdog for a call that cannot succeed.
 *
 * NEVER TerminateThread. A thread wedged inside comdlg32 holds the loader lock
 * and a COM apartment; killing it corrupts the process heap, which is a worse
 * outcome than the hang it would be trying to cure. So the thread is left
 * running and everything it can still touch -- the PRINTDLGEXW, the page-range
 * array, the property-sheet template and the choice it edits -- lives in ONE
 * heap block owned by whichever side wins an interlocked hand-off, never on the
 * caller's stack. If the call ever does come back, the thread frees the block
 * itself and nobody is waiting.
 *
 * AND IT IS ASKED ONCE. A host whose PrintDlgEx has been abandoned will do it
 * again, so the second Print does not start a second doomed thread: the
 * process-wide state is remembered and every later Print goes straight to the
 * in-app dialog. That is also the single in-flight guard -- a print dialog
 * cannot be opened twice at once.
 *
 * THE IN-APP DIALOG is spdf_win_print_dialog_show(): a plain Win32 window built
 * like spdf_win_properties_dialog.cpp and spdf_win_about.cpp beside it (no
 * resource script, the port's own theming, dark caption through
 * spdf_win_about_dark_caption), offering the four things a reader actually has
 * to choose -- the printer, the copies, the pages and the scale -- plus a
 * Properties button that reaches the DRIVER's own sheet through
 * DocumentPropertiesW DM_IN_PROMPT, which is measured to work here. What comes
 * out is a spdf_win_print_request; spdf_win_print_dialog_run() turns that into
 * a DC and hands it to the proven spdf_win_print_run_job().
 *
 * FOUR FILES, AND WHY. spdf_win_print_dialog_system.cpp is Windows' dialog and
 * the watchdog; spdf_win_print_dialog.cpp is the in-app window;
 * spdf_win_print_dialog_run.cpp is everything about the spooler that needs no
 * window (the printer list, the driver's property sheet, the range, the job);
 * and spdf_win_print_dialog_choose.cpp is only the order the two are asked in
 * and what is remembered afterwards. That last split is not tidiness: it keeps
 * settings.yaml -- and with it the state shell, the YAML codec, the recents
 * store and the watcher -- out of spdf_win_print.cpp, which
 * portable/win/tests/light_theme_test.c links for nothing but one page onto a
 * memory DC.
