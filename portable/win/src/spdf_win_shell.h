/* spdf_win_shell.h — the document's PATH handed to the desktop: Show in Folder,
 * Copy Path, Open in Browser, Open Path..., and where the Open dialog starts.
 *
 * WHAT THESE ARE THE PORT OF. GTK4's win.show-in-folder, win.copy-path and
 * win.open-in-browser (portable/linux/gtk4/spdf_shortcuts.c:66-68) and macOS's
 * File > Open Path... (Cmd+Shift+O). The Windows forms are the obvious ones --
 * the shell's own "select in Explorer", CF_UNICODETEXT, the default browser --
 * and portable/docs/windows-feature-matrix.md names the first explicitly:
 * "Windows = SHOpenFolderAndSelectItems". The Shenzhen Files file-manager
 * preference these sit beside on macOS is N/A here by design; the folder is
 * always Explorer's.
 *
 * THE OPEN DIALOG'S START FOLDER is a policy, and the policy is pure:
 * spdf_win_shell_open_start_dir() below takes the two facts it depends on and
 * returns a directory, so portable/win/tests/shell_test.c can pin it with no
 * dialog. 26.8.31-1: "starts in the document's folder"; else the folder of the
 * most recently opened document; else the user's home.
 *
 * Every function takes UTF-8 (the core's and the tab model's currency) and
 * widens at the Win32 boundary. Copy is never permission-gated (shenzhen_pdf_
 * core.h:209-214), and a path is not document text anyway.
