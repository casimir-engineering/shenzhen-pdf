/* spdf_win_tabs_app.h — the glue between the tab/session model and the app's
 * one canvas.
 *
 * Header-only and included by exactly one translation unit
 * (spdf_win_main.cpp). It is a header rather than a .cpp for two reasons:
 * spdf_win_main.cpp is at its line cap and this work does not belong inside it,
 * and a new .cpp would have to be added to the app's source list, which lives
 * in another track's file. Nothing here is part of the port's public surface;
 * silent_failure_support.h and spdf_win_session_json.h are the same
 * arrangement.
 *
 * This is the ONLY place where the model layer and the Win32/Direct2D layer
 * meet. spdf_win_tabs.h and spdf_win_session.h own no Win32 and no Direct2D on
 * purpose, so that the close policy and the session schema can be tested
 * headlessly; that separation only holds if the glue lives outside them, which
 * is here.
 *
 * The shape it imposes on the frontend:
 *
 *   - The MODEL owns documents. spdf_win_tabs opens one through the hook below
 *     the first time a tab is shown, and closes it when the tab closes.
 *   - main.cpp owns ONE canvas, belonging to whichever tab is selected.
 *     Switching tabs destroys it and builds a new one over the new tab's
 *     document. A canvas per tab would be nicer to switch to and would hold
 *     every tab's page cache resident; one canvas is the version that keeps a
 *     restored fifteen-tab session honest about memory as well as about
 *     startup time.
 *   - Restoring a session costs paths and view state and NOTHING else. The
 *     document behind a tab is opened the first time that tab is shown, which
 *     for every tab but one is never.
 *
 * WHAT A TAB REMEMBERS, AND HOW IT COMES BACK. remember() writes the whole
 * view -- page, zoom, the fit mode as one of the schema's five values (not
 * collapsed to width/custom as it once was), the scroll offset, and the live
 * find query -- into the tab. apply_view() puts it back on a canvas that has a
 * viewport: fit mode first, then the page (which measures the pages above it,
 * so the layout is exact there), then the exact offset. That order is what
 * makes "resume exactly where you left off" exact rather than page-accurate,
 * and it is also what the theme toggle relies on to keep the reader's place
 * while it rebuilds the canvas.
