/* The PAINT-TIME half of the Windows frontend's app glue: what the chrome model
 * is filled from, and the one callback spdf_win_window.h calls before every
 * frame.
 *
 * SPLIT OUT OF spdf_win_chrome_actions.h, which is where all of this used to
 * live, when the scroller work pushed that file past the 500-line cap. The seam
 * is a real one rather than a convenience: everything here runs on the PAINT
 * path and knows only how to describe the document to the chrome, while what is
 * left next door runs on the INPUT path and knows how to change the document.
 * The two touch at exactly two functions -- chrome_scroll_into(), which the
 * router needs because the scroller fractions are geometry, and
 * chrome_fit_for_zoom_mode(), which the fit cycle needs -- and both are here,
 * because a value's definition belongs with the code that produces it.
 *
 * Header-only and included from spdf_win_main.cpp AFTER `struct app`, exactly
 * like spdf_win_tabs_app.h, spdf_win_headless_viewport.h and
 * spdf_win_chrome_actions.h beside it, and BEFORE spdf_win_chrome_actions.h,
 * which calls the two functions named above. Not part of the port's public
 * surface.
 *
 * THE SIDEBAR IS DECIDED HERE, ONCE PER PAINT, the way mac rebuildSidebar
 * (ShenzhenPDFMac.mm:9552-9580) decides it: the panel exists only while the
 * document has something to list -- chapters, comments (none on Windows yet) or
 * a live search -- AND the reader wants it; the section shown is the chosen one
 * if it has content, else the first that does. Both answers are published
 * through spdf_win_sidebar_view.h's side channels so the input router's layout
 * (spdf_win_chrome_actions.h chrome_layout_for_input) reads the same ones the
 * painter drew with; the model fields the painter reads are set directly.
 */

/* For spdf_win_chrome_content_set_document(): scene_for_window tells the panels
 * which document is selected. Included here rather than relying on it arriving
 * through spdf_win_main.cpp's include order, which is what left this header
