/* spdf_win_chrome_find.h — FIND: the engine's public surface, the toolbar's find
 * controls, and the heat-map ticks.
 *
 * WHY THE ENGINE API IS HERE AND NOT IN spdf_win_search.h. That header is a
 * line-for-line transcription of portable/linux/gtk4/spdf_search_internal.h and
 * is differentially tested against it
 * (portable/win/tests/search-differential-native.cmd). Its value comes entirely
 * from being a pure transcription: anything added to it is something the
 * differential cannot check, sitting in the one file whose whole point is that
 * every line IS checked. So the engine that DRIVES that logic -- the worker
 * thread, the generation counter, the document handle -- declares itself here
 * instead, and spdf_win_search.h stays comparable to its original.
 *
 * THE THREE THINGS THIS FILE OWNS:
 *
 *   1. THE SESSION. One search per document: set the query, poll for results,
 *      step through matches. Everything expensive happens on a worker thread
 *      that opens its own spdf_document, so nothing here runs on the paint path
 *      or the launch path -- a document nobody searches costs one struct and no
 *      thread, which is the repo's standing speed rule (a feature costs nothing
 *      for documents that do not use it).
 *
 *   2. THE TOOLBAR'S READOUT. macOS's counter, which is NOT the GTK counter:
 *      "" with no query, "..." while searching, "0 / 0" on no match, else
 *      "<index+1> / <total>" (ShenzhenPDFMac.mm:3081-3086, 10631-10652). The
 *      counter AND the prev/next pill are hidden whenever the query is empty,
 *      which is a MODEL question rather than a layout one and so is answered by
 *      a predicate here that both the layout and the painter call.
 *
 *   3. THE HEAT-MAP TICKS, as document-height fractions in [0,1], thinned the
 *      way macOS thins them (SPDFMacUIHelpers.mm:453-479: a marker closer than
 *      1.5 pt to the previous one is dropped). The vertical trough is drawn by
 *      another track; this file produces what it draws, already deduplicated,
 *      because SpdfWinChromeModel's own comment forbids sorting or thinning on
 *      the paint path.
 *
 * The pure parts are C-compatible and free of Direct2D so a plain C test can
 * compile them; the painter declaration at the bottom is C++ only.

 * `pages`, `page_count`, `target_px_h` and `dpi_scale`, and writes only
 * `overlays` and `overlay_count`.
 *
 * IT OVERWRITES, IT DOES NOT APPEND. `scene->overlays` and `overlay_count` are
 * unconditionally replaced -- set to NULL/0 on every path that produces nothing,
 * including no query, no matches and no visible pages. Nothing else contributes
 * overlays today, so nothing is lost; a SELECTION track that also wants to
 * contribute must not simply call this after filling the array itself, because
 * its rects would vanish. The two ways out, in order of preference: give the
 * selection track its own kind and let ONE producer build the combined array, or
 * have each producer append into a scene-owned buffer with a length. Do not
 * discover this by debugging a disappearing selection.
 *
 * ORDER IS DRAW ORDER, which the overlay painter states. Every match is emitted
 * as SPDF_WIN_OVERLAY_SEARCH_MATCH in document order, and the ACTIVE match's
 * ring is held back and appended LAST so it draws over every fill -- including
 * the fills of matches on pages further down the canvas.
 *
 * LIFETIME. The array belongs to the SESSION, not to the scene and not to the
 * caller, and stays valid until the next spdf_win_find_apply_overlays() /
 * _apply_overlays_for() on that same session or until the session is freed --
 * which is the same contract spdf_win_canvas.h states for the page list it
 * borrows the geometry from. In particular it outlives the spdf_win_paint() that
 * follows, INCLUDING when a worker thread finishes a search in between: a worker
 * only ever appends to the session's private pending list under the lock, and
 * the match list the overlays were computed from is touched exclusively by
 * spdf_win_find_poll() on the UI thread. So a search completing mid-frame cannot
 * move, reallocate or free anything the scene is pointing at; the new matches
 * simply appear in the NEXT frame, which the session asks for by invalidating.
 *
 * The _for form takes the session explicitly, which is what makes the mapping
 * testable: portable/win/tests/find_overlay_test.c drives a session of its own
 * against a hand-built scene, with no window, no app and no environment. */
