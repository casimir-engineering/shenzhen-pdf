/* spdf_win_recents.h — recently opened documents, the reopen-closed ring, and
 * the per-document store behind them (documents.yaml).
 *
 * THE SCHEMA IS THE OTHER TWO FRONTENDS', NOT A NEW ONE. macOS and Linux share
 * these files -- a user who syncs %APPDATA%\ShenzhenPDF with
 * ~/Library/Application Support/ShenzhenPDF must find them meaningful -- so the
 * writer here produces what portable/linux/gtk4/spdf_state.c's documents_to_json
 * produces and what ShenzhenPDFMac.mm's writeStateObject:toFile:@"documents.yaml"
 * produces, member for member, sorted the way NSJSONWritingSortedKeys sorts:
 *
 *   documents.yaml   { "<path>": { "path", "showMinimap", "showSidebar",
 *                                  "title", "updatedAt" }, ... }
 *
 * plus any member this build does not model (the mac's page-geometry cache),
 * which is carried through verbatim rather than dropped.
 *
 * WHERE THE MRU LIST LIVES. Both other frontends persist the ordered
 * "recently opened" list as settings.yaml's "recentlyOpened" array (10 entries,
 * MRU first). settings.yaml is written by the windows track's settings module,
 * which this module must not write over -- two read-modify-write cycles of the
 * same file in one process would each lose the other's keys. So:
 *
 *   - the order is kept HERE, in memory, and DERIVED on load: settings.yaml's
 *     "recentlyOpened" is read (read-only) and seeds the list in its own order
 *     so a list written by the mac or GTK app is honoured; documents.yaml's
 *     "updatedAt" stamps fill in behind it, newest first;
 *   - every open stamps documents.yaml, which IS written here, so the order
 *     survives a relaunch even before the settings writer learns the key;
 *   - spdf_win_recents_merge_recently_opened() hands the settings writer a
 *     version of its JSON with "recentlyOpened" filled in, so the shared key is
 *     written once, by the file's one writer.
 *
 * Files are read and written through spdf_win_state.h's public entry points,
 * which is what gives them the YAML codec, the atomic replace and the
 * "unreadable is not absent" rule (spdf_win_state_read_status). Nothing here
 * opens a file itself.
 *
 * Process-wide state, loaded lazily on first use -- like the GTK SpdfState's
 * documents/favorites, which "load lazily on first use" so the launch path does
 * not pay for them. Not thread-safe; UI thread only.
