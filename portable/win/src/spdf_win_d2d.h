/* Direct2D compose layer for the Windows frontend.
 *
 * THE LOAD-BEARING RULE OF THIS FILE (windows-port-plan.md sec 3, risk 9):
 * nothing here may require an HWND. spdf_win_paint() takes an
 * ID2D1RenderTarget* and draws into it, and it does not care whether that
 * target is backed by a window or by a WIC bitmap in a session with no
 * desktop at all. The windowed path in spdf_win_window.cpp is a thin caller
 * of it; the headless path (spdf_win_render_scene_to_png, and T4's probe) is
 * another thin caller of the very same function.
 *
 * That is the entire reason Direct2D was chosen over WinUI/Qt: `prlctl exec`
 * runs in the SYSTEM session, so a compose path that needs a window is a
 * compose path no agent can ever verify.
 *
 * This header is C-safe on purpose. In a .c translation unit the Windows SDK
 * declares ID2D1RenderTarget and IWICImagingFactory as opaque interface
 * typedefs, which is all a C caller needs to hold a pointer and hand it back
 * to us -- so T4's spdf_win_probe.c can stay plain C even though the
 * implementation behind this header is C++. See spdf_win_d2d.cpp for why the
 * implementation cannot be C.

 *
 * These are the macOS palette's own literals, one variant each, transcribed
 * from portable/mac/markdown/SPDFMarkdownTheme.mm:23-27 -- which is the reading
 * theme for the WHOLE app, not just Markdown: SPDFMacDocumentViewTheme.mm:68-71
 * reads the same object for the PDF canvas. Named here rather than spelled as
 * D2D1::ColorF literals at the draw site for three reasons: the values are
 * citable against the Mac source, the compose path stays a pure function of
 * scene->dark (agents.md's render-determinism rule -- never appearance-dynamic,
 * never ambient), and a test can pin every one of them with no device, no
 * window and no desktop.
 *
 * `draws_page_shadow` / `draws_page_border` mirror SPDFMarkdownTheme's
 * `drawsPaperShadow` seam and are mutually exclusive by construction. Light
 * keeps the soft drop shadow; dark swaps it for a crisp 1 px paper-border frame,
 * because on the #121212 gutter a black shadow is invisible, so only one page
 * edge would ever read (SPDFMacDocumentViewTheme.mm:44-58 states exactly this).
 *
 * The light gutter is a hard-coded #E0E0E2 where macOS derives its own from
 * NSColor.windowBackgroundColor blended 8% toward black
 * (SPDFMacDocumentViewTheme.mm:16-41). Deriving the Windows equivalent from a
 * system colour is a separate change: it makes the value appearance-dynamic and
 * so has to be threaded in as a parameter rather than baked into this table.
 *
 * The shadow's own colour is NOT here. macOS uses a blurred NSShadow (radius
 * 12, offset (0,-2), black at alpha 0.28); Windows deliberately approximates it
 * with one flat band (see draw_canvas_page), and that approximation belongs at
 * its draw site, not in a palette shared with exact values. */
