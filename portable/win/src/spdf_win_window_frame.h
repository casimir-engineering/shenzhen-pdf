 * it: header-only, included from exactly one translation unit, AFTER
 * `struct spdf_win_window` because it dereferences it, and not part of the

 * exactly what it did there; they moved out when the menu bar pushed that file

 * rather than a raised one.
 *
 * WHAT BELONGS HERE: things that are true of the WINDOW rather than of a frame
 * of pixels or of a message. All four are properties an HWND has and a WIC
 * bitmap cannot -- which is exactly the boundary spdf_win_window.h already draws
 * for the reading theme's two window-level halves, and the reason none of this
