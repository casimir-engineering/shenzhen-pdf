/* Win32 message -> spdf_win_input translation, for spdf_win_window.cpp only.
 *
 * NOT A NEW LAYER. Every function here was in spdf_win_window.cpp and does
 * exactly what it did there; it moved out when routing the mouse through the
 * chrome pushed that file to its 500-line cap, and tools/file-size-limits.md
 * asks for an extracted file rather than a raised one. Same arrangement as
 * spdf_win_tabs_app.h and spdf_win_headless_viewport.h: header-only, included
 * from exactly one translation unit, AFTER `struct spdf_win_window` because it
 * dereferences it, and not part of the port's public surface.
 *
 * WHAT BELONGS HERE: turning a Win32 message into the small vocabulary
 * spdf_win_window.h declares -- filling in the fields every event carries,
 * converting WM_MOUSEWHEEL's screen point to client space, honouring the user's
 * SPI_GETWHEELSCROLLLINES, asking for a WM_MOUSELEAVE. WHAT DOES NOT: any
 * decision about what an event MEANS. That belongs to the caller, and the window
 * proc next door is the only thing that calls these.
