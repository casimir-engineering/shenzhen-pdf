/* spdf_win_health_log.h — WHERE the health lines go, WHEN they are written, and
 * the one thread that can still write when the UI thread cannot.
 *
 * The measurement half is spdf_win_health.h next door; this is the recording
 * half. It is separate because the two answer different questions and because
 * either one alone would take the other past the 500-line cap
 * (tools/file-size-limits.md asks for an extracted file rather than a raised
 * cap, which is the same move spdf_win_usage.h and spdf_win_headless.h made).
 *
 * THE FILE. <state dir>\launch-health.log -- beside settings.yaml and
 * session.yaml, so --state-dir moves it with everything else and a test never
 * writes into the reader's own state. Plain text, one line per entry, appended,
 * trimmed to the last SPDF_WIN_HEALTH_KEEP_LINES entries when it grows past
 * SPDF_WIN_HEALTH_TRIM_BYTES. A log that grows without bound is a log somebody
 * eventually deletes; a log of the last few launches is one they paste.
 *
 * THE THREE TIMES: 1 s, 5 s and 30 s after the window is shown.
 *
 *   1 s   is the launch itself -- is this window in front, enabled, on a
 *         monitor, with no hung window in the process? The two defects of
 *         section 11 (a hung prewarm window, a window shown at z-index 1) were
 *         both visible at one second and invisible to everything else.
 *   5 s   is after the reader's first click or keystroke, so the input counters
 *         are the evidence that the messages arrived at all. "Not responsive"
 *         has two very different causes -- input that never reaches the window
 *         and input the window ignores -- and only these counters tell them
 *         apart.
 *   30 s  is the settled state, and it is what a still-open window looks like
 *         when the reader gave up and closed it.
 *
 * ONE-SHOT TIMERS WITH A CALLBACK, not spdf_win_window_set_once: that slot is
 * single and already spoken for (app_watch_sweep_once). SetTimer with a non-NULL
 * TIMERPROC is dispatched by DispatchMessage straight to the callback without
 * reaching window_proc, so these three need no case in the window's message
 * switch and cannot perturb its routing. They run on the UI thread, which is
 * what makes their line an honest in-process measurement.
 *
 * AND THE WATCHDOG, WHICH IS THE POINT. A timer on the UI thread proves the UI
 * thread is running by firing; it can never report a UI thread that has stopped.
 * So a plain thread wakes every second, compares spdf_win_health.heartbeat_tick
 * against now, and writes a `stall` line when the gap exceeds
 * SPDF_WIN_HEALTH_STALL_MS. That -- and only that -- is the instrument for a
 * blocked message pump, which is the leading explanation for a window that was
 * "never responsive to any user input". It writes at most one line per
 * SPDF_WIN_HEALTH_STALL_REPEAT_MS while the stall lasts and at most
 * SPDF_WIN_HEALTH_STALL_MAX in the life of the process, so a genuinely wedged
 * app leaves evidence rather than a gigabyte.
