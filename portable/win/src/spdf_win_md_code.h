/* spdf_win_md_code.h -- the code box's in-page controls: a copy button on the
 * left of the box's top edge and a language pill on the right.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS FOR. 26.8.29-2 promises "a quiet language control in the box
 * header" that "opens instantly as a searchable list anchored to the code
 * block", and 26.9.2-1 adds "a copy button to the left of its language picker".
 * The Windows port has no HTML widgets -- the page is a picture MuPDF drew -- so
 * both are canvas chrome: a Direct2D pill drawn over the page after the pages
 * and before the window furniture, hit-tested against the very rectangles that
 * were drawn.
 *
 * GEOMETRY IS PUBLISHED, NOT QUERIED -- the same discipline spdf_win_annot.h
 * states and for the same reason. The input router knows nothing about pages,
 * so the paint that drew the pages hands over each control's rectangle in CLIENT
 * DEVICE PIXELS (spdf_win_md_code_publish_geometry) and the router tests points
 * against those (spdf_win_md_code_marks.h). Painting and hit-testing therefore
 * cannot disagree, because they are the same numbers.
 *
 * HOW A FENCE IS FOUND ON THE PAGE. Not by looking at the picture. The
 * converter puts id="spdf-code-N" on every <pre> and spdf_markdown_scan_fences
 * numbers the same N (portable/core/spdf_markdown_fences.c), so one
 * spdf_markdown_resolve_anchor per fence gives the page it landed on and the y
 * of its top edge, once per document rather than once per paint. The horizontal
 * extent is the stylesheet's own text column -- @page{margin:60pt 61pt}, so 61pt
 * in from each edge of the sheet, in points and therefore independent of the
 * A-/A+ text size. That is an approximation in exactly one case, a fence nested
 * inside a list, where the real box is indented; the pills then sit a little
 * wide of it. Nothing else in the reader depends on the number, and the
 * alternative -- reconstructing the box from the laid-out text's rectangles --
 * costs a structured-text pass per fence to buy a few points of accuracy.
 *
 * THE ROW RESTS ON the box's top edge, reaching a 2px lip inside it: the pills
 * read as chrome fastened to the box and still cannot cover a line of code,
 * which both a row inside the box and a row centred on its edge did -- the
 * anchor MuPDF resolves is the first line's BASELINE, and the box's own padding
 * is only 12pt, so there is no room in it for a 20px pill. The mac reserves a
 * band above the box instead, because its paginator can; MuPDF's cannot without
 * changing where every code block breaks, and an empty reserved band would then
 * appear in every printed and exported page, where there are no controls to put
 * in it.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE REACHES PRINT OR EXPORT, by construction rather than by a check:
 * the pills are painted only in the canvas phase of spdf_win_paint, and print,
 * Save as PDF and Copy Page render through spdf_export_pdf and the flagless
 * render path, which never see a scene. md_code_test pins that the published
 * marks are empty for a document that is not Markdown.
