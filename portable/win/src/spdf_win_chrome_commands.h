/* spdf_win_chrome_commands.h -- the KEYBOARD: the keymap, the three typeable
 * fields, and the one switch that performs a command whatever asked for it.
 *
 * Split out of spdf_win_main.cpp, which is at its 500-line cap and where
 * tools/file-size-limits.md asks for an extracted file rather than a raised one.
 * Header-only and included AFTER `struct app`, spdf_win_chrome_scene.h,
 * spdf_win_chrome_tabs_ui.h and spdf_win_chrome_actions.h -- it calls into all
 * four. Same arrangement as spdf_win_tabs_app.h beside it; not part of the
 * port's public surface.
 *
 * ONE SWITCH FOR EVERY ROUTE IN. A command can arrive from the menu bar
 * (WM_COMMAND), from an accelerator (WM_KEYDOWN matched against
 * spdf_win_menu.h's table) or, later, from a command palette. All three land in
 * command_perform() and therefore cannot behave differently -- which is the same
 * argument spdf_win_chrome_input.h makes for naming a mouse action after its
 * INTENT so "the keyboard and the mouse can converge on the same handler".
 *
 * THE ORDER INSIDE key_for_window() IS THE POINT, and it is:
 *
 *   1. ACCELERATORS, always, focused field or not. Ctrl+F must open the find
 *      field while the page field has the keyboard, and Ctrl+W must close the
 *      tab while the reader is halfway through a query. Every accelerator in the
 *      table carries Ctrl, Alt or a function key, so none of them is a character
 *      anyone could be trying to type.
 *   2. THE FOCUSED FIELD, if there is one. Left/Right move the caret rather than
 *      scrolling the page; Return commits; Escape gives the keyboard back to the
 *      document. An unrecognised key is SWALLOWED here rather than falling
 *      through, because a Down arrow that scrolled the document while the reader
 *      was typing in the toolbar would be indistinguishable from a bug.
 *   3. THE DOCUMENT. Exactly what it was before any of this existed.

 * is the same discipline the tab titles and the outline follow -- this machine's
 * ANSI code page is 1252 and a narrow conversion loses a CJK filename silently.
