/* Internal to the Windows frontend, like spdf_win_headless.h next to it.
 * Header-only so no build source list outside this directory needs a new .cpp,

 * it.
 *
 * The --render-window-png path: the continuous canvas, scrolled and zoomed,
 * composed into a WIC bitmap and written as a PNG, with the geometry it used
 * printed to stdout. Split out of spdf_win_main.cpp for the same reason
 * spdf_win_headless.h was -- to keep that file inside the size ratchet
 * (tools/file-size-limits.md) -- when the chrome model pushed it over.
 *
 * This path is how fit modes and scroll were checked for the whole port before
 * anyone could open a window, and it is still how they are checked: it and the
 * window call the same spdf_win_paint(), and the window's client area has been
 * measured byte-identical to what this produces at the same size and dpi
 * (portable/docs/windows-native-observations.md). Its printed geometry is the
 * oracle the pixel cases crop against, so the format of those two `frame` lines
 * is load-bearing -- portable/win/tests/run-tests-native.d2d.sh parses them.
