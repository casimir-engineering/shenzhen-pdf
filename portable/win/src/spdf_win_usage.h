/* The --help / bad-usage text, and nothing else.
 *
 * Extracted from spdf_win_main.cpp, which sat at its 500-line cap
 * (tools/file-size-limits.md asks for a focused file rather than a raised cap --
 * the same move spdf_win_headless.h, spdf_win_headless_viewport.h,
 * spdf_win_d2d_png.h and spdf_win_chrome_state.h all made). It is a genuine
 * seam despite being one function: this text is the app's command-line
 * CONTRACT, it is what a reader consults when a flag does not behave, and it is
 * the thing most often forgotten when a flag is added.
 *
 * Kept in sync with the parser by being next to nothing else. If you add a flag
 * to spdf_win_main.cpp, it belongs here in the same change.
