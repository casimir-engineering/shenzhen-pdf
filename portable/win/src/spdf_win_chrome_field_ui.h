/* spdf_win_chrome_field_ui.h -- the toolbar's find group, which field has the
 * keyboard, the sidebar's rows and segments, and how a search STARTS.
 *
 * Split out of spdf_win_chrome_actions.h for the reason
 * tools/file-size-limits.md gives, and along the seam that appeared when the
 * chrome became typeable: the file next door decides what a point MEANS and
 * performs the commands that change the DOCUMENT, and this one holds the
 * things that change what the CHROME is showing about it -- where the keyboard
 * is, what the query is, which match is current, which section and which row
 * was clicked.
 *
 * Header-only and included from spdf_win_main.cpp after `struct app` and
 * spdf_win_chrome_scene.h and BEFORE spdf_win_chrome_actions.h, whose
 * chrome_perform() calls every function here. Same arrangement as
 * spdf_win_chrome_tabs_ui.h and spdf_win_chrome_canvas_ui.h beside it. The
 * minimap's pointer handlers come in through spdf_win_search_map_ui.h, so
 * spdf_win_main.cpp's include list did not have to grow.
 *
 * HOW A SEARCH STARTS, and the four ways in -- all of them one function,
 * chrome_find_start(), so they cannot drift:
 *
 *   typing        a printable character with no field focused REPLACES the
 *                 query with it and gives the field the keyboard
 *                 (documentTypeToSearchKeyDown, ShenzhenPDFMac.mm:10169);
 *   Ctrl+F        with a live selection searches for the selection, whitespace
 *                 collapsed (focusFind :12134, GTK spdf_search_focus);
 *   Ctrl+V        with nothing focused searches for the clipboard text
 *                 (paste: :12151, GTK clipboard_text_ready);
 *   the field     every keystroke, as before.
 *
 * Every start also (a) shows the Search section, as macOS's
 * showSearchSidebarForFind does on every startFind, and (b) arms the REVEAL:
 * when the search settles, the view jumps to the first match -- or, with the
 * "search jumps to the nearest result" setting on (the default), to the match
 * nearest the reader's position (:10653, spdf_win_search_nearest_match). The
 * reveal runs at paint time, because that is when results arrive.
