/* spdf_win_chrome_input.h — what a mouse event over the chrome MEANS.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS: one pure function that turns (how the client area is divided,
 * what the chrome is showing, where the pointer is, which button) into an
 * ACTION plus the hover state the painter needs. No Win32, no Direct2D, no app
 * state, no allocation, header-only -- the third member of the family
 * spdf_win_chrome.h and spdf_win_tabstrip.h belong to, and testable the same way
 * (portable/win/tests/chrome_input_test.c).
 *
 * WHY IT IS A SEPARATE LAYER, given that the window could just hit-test inline.
 *
 *   1. spdf_win_chrome.h says the reason out loud: "Hit-testing and painting
 *      must agree exactly. On macOS they do because AppKit owns both; here they
 *      agree only if they call the same functions." Everything below calls
 *      spdf_win_chrome_hit(), spdf_win_tabstrip_hit(), spdf_win_tabstrip_close_hit()
 *      and spdf_win_toolbar_hit() -- the same four the painters use -- and
 *      derives nothing of its own. Re-deriving would mean re-deriving their bug
 *      fixes too (portable/docs/windows-port-plan.md §2.3).
 *   2. A window proc cannot be tested. This can: a click at (x, y) on a
 *      hand-built layout must produce a named action, and that assertion needs
 *      no HWND, no desktop and no document -- which is the only kind of evidence
 *      this port has ever been able to collect in bulk.
 *   3. Which control does what is PRODUCT POLICY, and spdf_win_window.h already
 *      states the rule for that: "the caller owns the keymap: which key means
 *      'next page' is product policy, not window plumbing." A mouse map is the
 *      same thing. So the window translates messages, this header names the
 *      meaning, and spdf_win_main.cpp performs it.
 *
 * WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO: it does not touch the canvas, the tab model,
 * or the chrome model. It reports SPDF_WIN_CA_CANVAS and lets the caller run the
 * existing pan/zoom path unchanged, which is what keeps drag-to-pan and
 * Ctrl+wheel exactly as they were everywhere the chrome is not.
 *
 * COORDINATES. Client device pixels in, matching WM_LBUTTONDOWN's own space and
 * the space every rect in SpdfWinChromeLayout is expressed in. The canvas is a
 * SUB-RECT of the client now, so a caller forwarding a point to the canvas must
 * subtract layout->canvas.x/y first: spdf_win_chrome_input_canvas_x/y() below do
 * that conversion so no caller has to remember to. Getting it wrong makes a
 * cursor-anchored zoom drift by the sidebar's width.
