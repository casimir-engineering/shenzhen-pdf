/* spdf_win_window_doc.h -- the ONE document the headless paths open, how an
 * error is reported, and the UTF-16 -> UTF-8 step every path argument takes.
 *
 * Header-only and included from spdf_win_main.cpp immediately after `struct
 * app`, before every other glue header: report() is what all of them report
 * through, open_document() is what spdf_win_headless.h and
 * spdf_win_headless_viewport.h open through, and utf8_from_wide() is what a
 * dropped or dialog-chosen path goes through in spdf_win_chrome_tabs_ui.h.
 * Every function here was in spdf_win_main.cpp and does exactly what it did
 * there; they moved out when the session and presentation work pushed that
 * file past its 500-line cap, and tools/file-size-limits.md asks for an
 * extracted file rather than a raised one. Not part of the port's public
 * surface.
