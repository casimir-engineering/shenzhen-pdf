/* spdf_win_lru.h — the Win32 frontend's bounded cache of rendered pages.
 *
 * A rendered page is expensive to produce and cheap to throw away, so every
 * ShenzhenPDF frontend keeps a cache of them under a byte budget. This is the
 * Windows port of the GTK4 one (spdf_lru_* in
 * portable/linux/gtk4/spdf_docview_internal.h, itself the GTK3 minimap
 * thumbnail store generalised for the render texture cache), and it implements
 * that policy exactly — portable/win/tests/lru_cache_test.c drives this cache
 * and the real GTK cache through the same operation script and asserts the two
 * agree on size, byte total, membership and destroy count after every step.
 *
 * THE POLICY, and why it is this one:
 *
 *   - The budget is in DECODED BYTES, not entries. Page bitmaps differ in size
 *     by three orders of magnitude between an A5 page at 25% and a 10900pt
 *     schematic sheet at 400%; an entry-count cap either wastes memory or
 *     thrashes, depending on the document.
 *   - Eviction is strictly least-recently-USED: `lookup` bumps recency, insert
 *     bumps recency. Recency is a monotonically increasing counter, so ties are
 *     impossible and the victim is deterministic — which is what makes a
 *     cross-implementation differential test meaningful at all.
 *   - The cache NEVER evicts to empty. A single entry larger than the whole
 *     budget stays resident, because the alternative is that the page you are
 *     looking at is the one page that can never be cached. This is the
 *     `g_hash_table_size(...) > 1` guard in the GTK original.
 *   - `set_cap` evicts immediately, so shrinking the budget takes effect now
 *     rather than at the next insert.
 *
 * Budget default: SPDF_WIN_MAX_RENDER_SURFACE_BYTES (96MB), the same default
 * the GTK render service passes to spdf_lru_init. The mac frontend bounds the
 * same thing differently — a 192MB soft limit that drains to a 128MB target,
 * with a ±12-page keep window pinned around the current page
 * (kRenderedImageSoftByteLimit / kRenderedImageTargetByteLimit /
 * kRenderedImageKeepRadius in ShenzhenPDFMac.mm). The keep window is really a
 * prefetch policy dressed as an eviction policy: on both platforms the pages
 * near the viewport are the pages most recently drawn, so LRU keeps them for
 * the same reason mac pins them, without the frontend having to tell the cache
 * where the viewport is. The Windows port takes the GTK shape because it is the
 * one that is already pure, already tested, and already agrees with mac on
 * observable behaviour; a caller that wants mac's larger budget calls
 * spdf_win_lru_set_cap.
 *
 * Pure C, no Windows headers. Thread safety is the caller's: the GTK render
 * service holds its own mutex across every cache call, and spdf_win_render is
 * expected to do the same.
