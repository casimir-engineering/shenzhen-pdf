.SYNOPSIS
  Launch ShenzhenPDF.exe, wait for its window, capture it to a PNG, close it.

.DESCRIPTION
  The Windows port was built entirely from a macOS host driving a Parallels VM
  through `prlctl exec`, which runs as `nt authority\system` and therefore has
  NO INTERACTIVE DESKTOP. Every visual claim in this repo before 2026-09-01 was
  a build, an exit code, or an offscreen render -- nobody had ever seen the
  window. See portable/docs/windows-port-handoff.md sec 0.

  This script exists so that "look at the window" is a repeatable command
  rather than a human favour, and so a screenshot can be diffed against
  docs/images/portable/macos-main-window.webp.

  It captures with PrintWindow(hwnd, dc, PW_RENDERFULLCONTENT), not a
  screen-region grab, so the result is the window's own pixels: no desktop
  wallpaper bleeding in, no other window overlapping it, and it works when the
  window is not foreground. PW_RENDERFULLCONTENT (0x2) is required for a window
  drawing through Direct2D/DirectComposition -- without it a hardware-composed
  client area comes back blank, which would look exactly like "the app painted
  nothing" and send you hunting a bug that is not there.

  It always tries to close the app it started. A stray ShenzhenPDF.exe, a stray
  message box, or a maximised window left behind is the Windows equivalent of
  the repo rule "do not launch the macOS app" -- the user has this machine in
  front of them while agents work (agents.md).

.PARAMETER Exe
  Path to ShenzhenPDF.exe.

.PARAMETER Pdf
  Document to open. Prefer portable/win/tests/fixtures/golden.pdf or another
  fixture over anything of the user's -- a screenshot ends up in a report.

.PARAMETER Out
  Destination PNG path.

.PARAMETER AppArgs
  Extra arguments passed through to the app, e.g. --dark.

.PARAMETER Width / Height
  Optional client-area size to force via MoveWindow before capturing, so two
  runs are comparable. Omit to accept whatever the app chose (which is itself
  worth capturing at least once -- the default size is a parity question).

.PARAMETER SettleMs
  How long to let the app render after its window appears. The canvas renders
  pages on a worker pool, so an immediate capture can catch placeholder paper
  instead of a page -- which would be a false "the page did not render" report.

.OUTPUTS
  Writes the PNG and prints one `key=value` line per fact for a caller to
  parse. Exit codes are distinct so a harness can tell the failures apart, and
  nothing is decided by piping this through grep (a repo rule -- see
  portable/docs/windows-port-handoff.md sec 5):
    0  captured
    64 bad usage / missing input
    65 process exited before a window appeared
    66 timed out waiting for a window
    67 capture itself failed
    68 the capture came back blank because the desktop is not composited --
       almost always a LOCKED workstation. This is a BLOCKED, not a failure:
       nothing has been shown about the app. See DistinctColors below.

# A LOCKED WORKSTATION CANNOT BE SCREENSHOTTED, AND SAYING SO UP FRONT SAVES AN

# Windows does not composite a locked session. The DWM-drawn title bar still

# backed by a GPU surface does not: PrintWindow returns black or stale garbage,
# and CopyFromScreen returns pure black for the entire screen.
#
# The failure is convincing in the worst way. It looks exactly like the app
# painting nothing -- and it REPRODUCES, including from a clean build of a
# known-good commit, which is how one investigation concluded the window had
# regressed when it had not. The offscreen compose of the very same binary was
# perfect throughout, which is the tell: spdf_win_paint() needs no desktop.
#
# So this is checked BEFORE the app is launched (no point starting it) and
# reported as its own exit code, so a harness records BLOCKED rather than FAIL.
# Nothing has been learned about the app either way.
