@echo off
rem Native Windows build. No VM, no prlctl, no \\Mac share -- this runs on the
rem Windows box that owns the checkout.
rem
rem   portable\win\build-native.cmd                          build ShenzhenPDF.exe
rem   portable\win\build-native.cmd <target> <source>...     build one target
rem   portable\win\build-native.cmd --print-sources          print the app source list
rem   portable\win\build-native.cmd --help
rem
rem Sources are REPO-RELATIVE (either slash works): portable/core/spdf_yaml.c.
rem
rem INVOKE IT BY PATH. This box has NoDefaultCurrentDirectoryInExePath=1, so a
rem bare `build-native.cmd` is not found even from portable\win. Use
rem `.\build-native.cmd` or an absolute path. Nothing here depends on the
rem current directory: the repo root is derived from %~dp0 and every source is
rem handed to cl.exe as an absolute path.
rem
rem CONTRACT: this script's exit code IS cl.exe's exit code, verbatim. Nothing
rem here may swallow a failure -- portable/win/tests/run-tests-native.sh reads
rem it as the whole truth about whether a target built, and so does every
rem "did it build?" check after this. Infrastructure failures use codes 64-93 so
rem they stay distinguishable from a genuine compile error (cl.exe returns 2).
rem
rem NB: every conditional below uses a parenthesised block. The tempting
rem one-liner "if errorlevel 1 echo msg & exit /b 90" is WRONG in cmd: the &
rem chain is parsed as a sibling command, so the exit runs unconditionally and
rem the script fails every build. Do not "simplify" these back.
rem
rem Delayed expansion is deliberately OFF. The MSVC environment vcvarsall.bat
rem installs is large and not guaranteed free of `!`, and the source lists are
rem accumulated through :add_* subroutines, which re-expand on every call and so
rem need no `!` at all.

rem every target whose code is pure C over portable/core keeps building on a
rem machine where MuPDF has never been built. The linker only pulls in the
rem objects a symbol actually needs, so a target that ignores MuPDF pays nothing
rem but the cost of opening the archives. A target that DOES need it fails at
rem the link with unresolved fz_*/pdf_* symbols -- loudly, never silently.

rem ---- 3. Compile --------------------------------------------------------

rem Flags copied verbatim from portable/win/guest-build.cmd:112 -- the two build
rem entry points must not drift. /MT is stated explicitly because libmupdf.lib
rem is built /MT too, and mixing CRTs produces link errors that read like
rem missing symbols. /STACK:8388608 matches macOS's 8 MB main thread: Windows
rem defaults to 1 MB and MuPDF's content-stream and CSS recursion can outrun
rem that on real files.
rem THE APP IS A GUI PROGRAM; THE TEST BINARIES ARE CONSOLE PROGRAMS.
rem
rem Without /SUBSYSTEM the linker defaults to CONSOLE because the entry point is
rem main(), and Windows then allocates a terminal window for the app that sits
rem there for the life of the process. Reported from actual use: "it runs from a
rem terminal window that stays open". macOS and GTK show no such thing.
rem
rem /ENTRY:mainCRTStartup keeps main() as written -- the alternative is renaming
rem it to wWinMain, which would gain nothing and cost every caller of
rem CommandLineToArgvW below it.
rem
rem This is applied ONLY to the app. The ~20 test binaries are console programs
rem on purpose: they print their results, and a harness reads them.
rem
rem stdout still works for the harness. Subsystem controls only whether a console
rem is ALLOCATED; when a parent redirects stdout to a pipe or a file -- which is
rem what run-tests-native.d2d.sh and verify-phase1.ps1 do when they parse the
rem `frame ...` geometry lines -- the CRT picks that handle up from STARTUPINFO
rem and printf reaches it unchanged. Measured after this change, not assumed.

rem ---- 3a. Resources (app only) --------------------------------------------
rem portable\win\spdf_win.rc carries the icon, the manifest (per-monitor-v2
rem DPI, long paths, common controls 6) and VERSIONINFO, with its numbers taken
rem from portable\win\src\spdf_win_about_version.h -- hence the /I. rc.exe
rem ships in the same Windows SDK that provides the headers cl.exe already
rem needs, and vcvarsall puts it on PATH; a missing rc.exe is an infrastructure
rem failure (66), not a compile error, so it stays distinguishable. The .res is
rem handed to cl.exe on the command line, which passes it to the linker.
rem
rem The ~20 test binaries get no resources on purpose: they are console
rem programs, and a manifest declaring PerMonitorV2 would change how the
rem window-opening tests (properties_dialog_test) measure themselves.
