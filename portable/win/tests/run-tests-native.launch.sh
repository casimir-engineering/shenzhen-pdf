# The launch budget: does the window still come up, and the first page still
# paint, inside a time a person would call instant?
#
# WHAT IT ASSERTS. portable/win/measure-launch.ps1 launches the freshly built
# ShenzhenPDF.exe on outline.pdf several times and takes medians of two numbers,
# both measured from the process's kernel creation time:
#
#   window visible   -- the host sees a visible top-level window (external);
#   first page       -- the app's own `first-compose-end` mark, i.e. the first
#                       EndDraw of the first WM_PAINT returned (in-process,
#                       spdf_win_launch_profile.h). When the exe carries no
#                       markers the sampler's first non-blank client frame
#                       stands in.
#
# THE BUDGETS ARE GENEROUS ON PURPOSE. This is a regression tripwire, not the
# target: the target (window < 100 ms, first page < 150 ms warm) and the
# measured state live in portable/docs/windows-launch-performance.md. Other
# tracks build on this machine while the suite runs and a median of five
# absorbs a few slow runs, but a budget tight enough to be the goal would fail
# on every busy afternoon and be ignored by the evening. Tighten them with a
# measurement, in the doc, never here first.
#
# BLOCKED, NOT FAILED, when the workstation is locked: the desktop is not
# composited then and the numbers describe nothing a person sees. The harness
# exits 68 for that; it is mapped to BLOCKED, so the suite exits 2, as it does
# for every other host-blocked case.
#
# The user's live session.yaml is backed up and restored by the harness around
# every launch; see its SESSION SAFETY note.
#
# Sourced by run-tests-native.sh, never executed. Needs harness-lib.sh and
# run-tests-native.lib.sh.

# one on a display that is not attached. windows-native-observations.md,

# THE FLOOD: does the UI thread keep answering while a person hammers the
# window and the file under it changes? portable/win/tests/stress-window.ps1
# drives the built exe through SendInput for STRESS_DURATION_MS -- wheel,
# paging, zoom, find, the sidebar toggle, resizes -- rewriting the open
# document every two seconds so the watcher reloads it under load, and asserts
# every STRESS_PING_EVERY_MS that SendMessageTimeout(WM_NULL) answers within
# STRESS_PING_TIMEOUT_MS, that no window of the process is hung, that a
# PageDown still repaints at the end, and that WM_CLOSE ends the process.
#
# WHY IT EXISTS. "The app was never responsive to any user input" was reported
# twice with every test green: nothing in the suite had ever driven the window
# for longer than a launch, and a UI thread that waits on a worker or on another
# process (windows-native-observations.md section 13) looks fine for the two
# seconds a launch check watches it. BLOCKED, like launch.budget, when the
# workstation is locked (68) -- and when the desktop refuses the launched window
# the foreground (69), because SendInput then reaches nothing.

# --- launch.health ---------------------------------------------------------
#
# DOES THE WINDOW ANSWER? launch.budget proves a window appeared and painted;
# it cannot prove the window reacts to anything, because it never touches it.
# That gap is exactly where the report of 2026-09-05 lived -- "the app was
# never responsive to any user input and not even focusable" with every test
# green -- so this case sends REAL input and then asks the app what it saw.
#
# WHAT IT ASSERTS (portable/win/tests/launch-health.ps1):
#
#   1. a click on the toolbar's next-page button, a PageDown, and Ctrl+F with a
#      query typed into it each change the window's PrintWindow capture. The
#      click coordinate comes from `ShenzhenPDF.exe --print-layout`, i.e. from
#      the same layout the painter and the input router share, so the test
#      clicks the BUTTON rather than a coordinate someone measured once;
#   2. the app's OWN launch-health.log, written into the private --state-dir
#      this case hands it, says at 1 s: foreground, enabled, visible, not
#      iconic, not hung, z-index 0, a monitor found, on screen, not modal;
#   3. its input counters and paint total have moved by the 5 s line -- the app
#      agreeing, from the inside, that the input arrived;
#   4. the watchdog recorded no `stall`, i.e. the UI thread never stopped
#      pumping for three seconds.
#
# BLOCKED, NOT FAILED, in the two states where the question cannot be asked: a
# locked workstation (nothing is composited, so no capture can differ) and a
# desktop where the app cannot be brought to the front (real input goes to
# whoever is in FRONT, and typing into somebody else's window is worse than not
# testing). Both are 68. The harness runs under a shell under an editor, which
# Windows does not grant the foreground, so the script asks for it through the
# foreground thread's input queue and reports BLOCKED when the system still
# refuses -- see launch-health.ps1's Raise().
