#!/usr/bin/env bash
# The Windows port's test runner for a NATIVE Windows checkout. Git Bash, one
# machine, no Parallels, no prlctl, no \\Mac share.
#
#   portable/win/tests/run-tests-native.sh [--list] [--filter PAT]
#                                          [--self-check] [--keep] [--quiet]
#
# The sibling of run-tests.sh, which is a macOS-side orchestrator: it drives a VM
# over prlctl and compares against macOS reference renders the Mac produces. On a
# Windows box roughly half of that is meaningless and the other half is the part
# you want. Everything here builds and runs locally through
# portable/win/build-native.cmd.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# THE ONE THING THIS SCRIPT MUST GET RIGHT
#
# It must exit non-zero when a test fails. A harness that always exits 0 does not
# merely fail to help -- it silently blesses every broken change made after it,
# and every later track's "green" becomes meaningless. Three habits protect that,
# and none of them may be "simplified" away (portable/docs/windows-port-handoff.md
# section 2.6):
#   1. No `set -e`: an early exit would skip the aggregation entirely.
#   2. NOTHING is piped through grep/tee/head to decide pass or fail. A pipeline
#      reports the LAST command's status, so `prog | grep -c ok` is green when
#      prog crashes. Output goes to a file with `> log 2>&1`; the very next
#      statement reads $?.
#   3. Every case's status is recorded and the exit status is computed from the
#      records at the end -- never from whatever ran last.
#
# `harness.exit-code` proves 1-3 empirically -- a native binary that exits 3 and
# 42, and a source that cannot compile -- and `--self-check` proves the runner
# itself turns a failing case into a non-zero exit.
#
# HONEST DEGRADATION. A case whose prerequisites are missing is recorded BLOCKED,
# printed with the exact thing that is missing, and still makes the run exit
# non-zero -- exit 2 rather than 1, so "waiting on MuPDF" stays distinguishable
# from "the code is broken", but never zero. A harness that reported success
# because it could not run anything is the failure mode this file exists to
# prevent. While libmupdf.lib does not exist, a correct run of this script exits
# 2. Use --filter to work on one area; do not teach it to exit 0.
#
# NOT EVERY CASE CAN RUN HERE, AND THE ONES THAT CANNOT ARE STILL LISTED. The
# cross-host comparisons need a macOS host to build their reference; they are
# recorded BLOCKED with the reason, never dropped, because they are the port's
# strongest evidence and quietly losing them is how a port stops being checked.
# run-tests-native.d2d.sh adds four Windows-internal substitutes under their own
# d2d.compose-* names -- read its header before treating them as equivalent.
#
# WINDOWS NOTES. cmd.exe is invoked with MSYS2_ARG_CONV_EXCL='*' so MSYS leaves
# `/c` alone instead of rewriting it to `C:\`. This box may have
# NoDefaultCurrentDirectoryInExePath=1, so build-native.cmd is always addressed
# by absolute path -- and so must this script be, or `./run-tests-native.sh`.
# Paths handed to a native .exe go through `cygpath -w`.
#
# ADDING A TEST: drop `portable/win/tests/<name>_test.c` in this directory and it
# is discovered automatically as case `win.<name>_test`. Declare extras in the
# file itself; paths are repo-relative:
#
#     /* spdf-test-sources: portable/core/spdf_win_compat.c */
#     /* spdf-test-args: portable/win/tests/fixtures/golden.pdf */
#     /* spdf-test-needs: mupdf */
#     /* spdf-test-host: mac */      <- never built here
#
# portable/core/spdf_win_compat.c belongs in EVERY Windows source list: it is the
# POSIX shim shenzhen_pdf_core.c:5, spdf_yaml.c:6 and six core suites #include,
# and omitting it produces a wall of
# `LNK2019: unresolved external symbol spdf_compat_*` rather than an error at the
# file that wanted it. Its path is portable/core/, NOT portable/win/src/;
# run-tests.sh's own header comment gets that wrong.
