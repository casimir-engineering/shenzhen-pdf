/* modal_scope_test.c -- NO DIALOG MAY LEAVE THE MAIN WINDOW DISABLED.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. A disabled Win32 window cannot be activated by a click, by
 * Alt+Tab, or by SetForegroundWindow. It still repaints, still answers WM_NULL,
 * and is never marked "not responding" -- so an app whose main window has been
 * left disabled by a dialog that is invisible, off-screen, on another thread or
 * never shown at all looks EXACTLY like the report this file was written for:
 * "the app was never responsive to any user input and not even focusable".
 * Nothing in the suite could see that state, because every existing dialog test
 * passes a NULL owner and so never disables anything.
 *
 * FOUR THINGS ARE CHECKED, in increasing cost:
 *
 *   1. THE PLACEMENT ARITHMETIC, headless. spdf_win_modal_place_point() is pure,
 *      so a dialog centred on an owner near a screen edge, an owner on a second
 *      monitor, and a dialog larger than the work area are all decided here with
 *      no window at all.
 *
 *   2. THE SCOPE, against a real owner window: it disables, it re-enables, a
 *      NESTED scope does not re-enable early, closing twice is harmless, and a
 *      scope opened from a thread that does NOT own the window refuses to
 *      disable it -- the cross-thread disable is the failure mode with no way
 *      out, so the scope declines it rather than performing it.
 *
 *   3. THE REAL PLACEMENT, against a real owner: the dialog rectangle ends up
 *      inside the owner's monitor work area, not at the primary monitor's
 *      cascade position.
 *
 *   4. THE REGRESSION, and the reason for the whole round. File > Print calls
 *      PrintDlgExW on a thread it is allowed to wedge in and watches for a
 *      window to appear; the owner is disabled for that wait. The watchdog used
 *      to treat ANY new visible window of this process as "the dialog is up" and
 *      then stopped its clock FOREVER. But the calling thread keeps pumping
 *      during the wait, and what it dispatches puts windows up -- the updater's
 *      task dialog is on a timer that fires into exactly that pump. One such
 *      window, appearing and closing again while PrintDlgExW never returns, left
 *      the main window disabled with nothing on screen and no way back. This
 *      case creates that window deliberately, from another thread, and asserts
 *      the call still comes back and the owner is enabled afterwards.
 *
 * IT OPENS TWO WINDOWS ON THE DESKTOP FOR A FEW SECONDS, the same deliberate
 * cost properties_dialog_test.c and print_watchdog_test.c already pay. Both are
 * destroyed, and a hard timeout kills the process rather than letting this test
 * become the hang it tests for.
 *
 * ON A LOCKED WORKSTATION no window can be created at all: the test exits 68,
 * which run-tests-native.sh records as BLOCKED rather than as a pass or a fail.
 * Nothing would have been learned about this code either way.
