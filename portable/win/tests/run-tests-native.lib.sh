#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Plumbing for portable/win/tests/run-tests-native.sh: how a target is built and
# run on a native Windows box, how prerequisites are discovered, and the three
# cases that prove the harness itself is honest.
#
# Split from run-tests-native.sh so that file can stay about WHAT is tested while
# this one stays about HOW the toolchain is driven, and so both remain under the
# repo's 500-line cap (tools/file-size-limits.md). Sourced, never executed. The
# same division as run-tests.sh / harness-lib.sh, whose record(), say(),
# selected(), declared(), declared_line(), log_tail() and mupdf_link_defect()
# this file also relies on -- harness-lib.sh must be sourced first.
#
# THE RULE THAT GOVERNS THIS FILE: nothing here may stand between a build or a
# binary and its exit status. native_build() and native_run() are deliberately
# as dumb as a function can be -- a redirect, then `return $?` -- because every
# piece of cleverness added here is a place a Windows failure could be
# swallowed, and a swallowed failure makes the entire port's test story a lie.
#
# Unlike harness-lib.sh, this file may use bash 4 features: it runs on Git Bash
# (bash 5), never on the macOS system bash 3.2.

# --- native plumbing -------------------------------------------------------

# Build output lives outside the checkout, matching build-native.cmd and
# guest-build.cmd, so a clean or a sync can never delete it. Normalised to a
# Windows path because that is what the .cmd consumes, and mirrored as a POSIX
# path because that is what bash consumes.

# MuPDF and BLOCK every case that links it. Measured: two agents building into
# the same C:\spdf-build at once produced five spurious "does not build"
# failures, because the exe under test was replaced mid-run.
