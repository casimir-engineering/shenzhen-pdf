.SYNOPSIS
  Check Phase 1's five done-criteria against a real ShenzhenPDF window.

.DESCRIPTION
  portable/docs/windows-port-plan.md states Phase 1's done-bar as: the window
  opens, the page is visible and correctly scaled to the client area, resizing
  repaints, DPI scaling is correct on a 2x display, closing exits 0.

  Every one of those five was UNOBSERVED until 2026-09-01. The port was built
  from a macOS host driving a Parallels VM over `prlctl exec`, which runs as
  `nt authority\system` with no interactive desktop, so nobody had ever seen the
  window (portable/docs/windows-port-handoff.md sec 0). This script is how the
  five stop being claims.

  HOW "CORRECTLY SCALED" IS DECIDED, AND WHY IT IS THE STRONG CHECK.
  The app can compose the same canvas without a window at all:
  `--render-window-png <pdf> <page> <w> <h> <out.png>` runs spdf_win_paint over
  a WIC target and prints the geometry it used. So this script captures the real
  window's CLIENT AREA and compares it to a headless render at exactly the
  client size, at zero tolerance. That is a much stronger statement than "the
  page looks about right": it says the windowed path and the offscreen path
  produce identical pixels, which is what makes every offscreen pixel test in
  this port actual evidence about the window. spdf_win_d2d.h's rule that
  spdf_win_paint must never require an HWND is what allows the comparison, and
  this is the first check that exercises it.

  THE HOST MUST BE DPI-AWARE. See screenshot-window.ps1's BecomeDpiAware
  comment: a DPI-unaware caller gets virtualised rects, and the resulting
  capture is a top-left crop that mimics "the app renders at the wrong scale"
  convincingly enough to send you debugging the app instead of the harness.

  Judged by exit code, never by grepping this output (a repo rule):
    0  all selected criteria passed
    1  at least one criterion FAILED

  #
  # The window's canvas region is BYTE-IDENTICAL to the headless compose at most
  # client sizes (1098x744, 900x700, 1300x900: 0 differing pixels). It diverges
  # where DrawBitmap has to resample the page bitmap hard, and the divergence
  # grows with the scale factor:
  #
  #     bitmap 1426 px into a 1425.6 px slot   ->  0.76% differ, maxdelta 2
  #     bitmap ~1000 px into a 208 px slot     ->  11.2% differ, maxdelta 43,
  #                                                MAE 0.60, 99.9th pct 27
  #
  # It is neither flakiness nor a repaint bug, and that was established rather
  # than assumed: two runs of the same WINDOW are byte-identical to each other,
  # two runs of the HEADLESS path are byte-identical to each other, and every
  # differing pixel lies inside the page bitmap -- the gutter above the page
  # matches exactly, 0 of 2704 px. The window paints into an HWND target created
  # with D2D1_RENDER_TARGET_TYPE_DEFAULT (GPU); spdf_win_render_scene_to_png
  # deliberately uses D2D1_RENDER_TARGET_TYPE_SOFTWARE. The two rasterisers'
  # bilinear filters simply do not agree bit-for-bit, and disagree more the
  # further the scale is from 1:1.
  #
  # This matters beyond this script: the port's zero-tolerance pixel cases all
  # run SOFTWARE on both sides (probe versus --render-window-png), so they are
  # unaffected. What they do NOT certify is the GPU window's resampled pixels.
  #
  # So the criterion is MAE plus a ceiling, not bit-equality. MAE <= 1.0 is two
  # orders of magnitude below anything a real fault produces: a wrong zoom,
  # origin, fit mode, theme colour or a stale texture moves the mean by tens.
  # The maxdelta ceiling of 64 still catches a single grossly wrong region.
