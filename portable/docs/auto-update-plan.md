# Auto-update plan for Shenzhen PDF

## TL;DR

Add a **lazy, once-per-day, very-low-priority** GitHub-release self-updater compiled into the single Objective-C++ binary but **gated at runtime to the non-sandboxed Developer ID build only** (the App Store / TestFlight build is updated by the App Store and must never self-update). At launch, strictly after first paint, the primary process checks the latest GitHub release at most once per machine per day. If a genuinely newer, non-skipped version exists, it asks the user; on consent it downloads the notarized DMG, **verifies it offline (Developer ID + Team ID `66LJ4BV7Q3` pin + stapled notarization ticket)**, extracts the inner `.app`, atomically swaps the running bundle, and relaunches — restoring the full multi-window session.

The single integrity boundary is the **code-signature + Team-ID + stapled-ticket gate on the downloaded file**. Everything else (size, optional SHA-256) is a corruption heuristic, never a trust decision.

**Ship only the existing DMG.** No separate zipped `.app`.

All file:line references are to `/Users/raph/Projects/shenzhen-pdf/portable/`.

## DMG vs separate .app — recommendation (answer the user's exact question)

**Ship ONLY the existing notarized + stapled `ShenzhenPDF-mac-arm64.dmg` in the GitHub release. Do NOT add a separate zipped `.app`.** The updater mounts the DMG and `ditto`-extracts the `.app` itself.

Reasons, grounded in the real pipeline:

1. **The DMG is the single canonical, already-notarized+stapled artifact.** A second zipped artifact doubles upload size and creates divergence risk (two payloads that could disagree) for zero benefit. The mount → extract → verify → detach path is cheap (~1s, once per update) and idiomatic in this codebase (NSTask shell-outs already used at `ShenzhenPDFMac.mm:1936` / `:8244`).

2. **Correcting a common (wrong) justification — and an important caveat.** The reason is *not* "only the DMG is offline-stapled." I verified `Makefile:137` is exactly `xcrun stapler staple "$(MAC_DMG)"` — it staples **only the DMG**; `stapler` does **not** recurse into the DMG's contents, and there is no separate staple of the inner `.app` in the committed pipeline. So whether the *extracted* inner `.app` carries its own ticket depends on the build path and is **not guaranteed**. The DMG-only recommendation stands for the correct reasons (single canonical artifact, cheap one-time mount, no divergence) — and the verification design below is built so it **does not depend on the inner app being independently stapled** (see Security gates §5.6).

3. **The shipped DMG layout has diverged from the committed Makefile — flagged for the user.** The live `dist/ShenzhenPDF-mac-arm64.dmg` mounts with **both `ShenzhenPDF.app` and an `Applications` symlink** plus a custom background, and its codesign Identifier is `ShenzhenPDF-installer`. But the committed `Makefile:121` (`hdiutil create -volname "Shenzhen PDF" -srcfolder "$(MAC_APP)" … UDZO`) produces a plain volume with no symlink/background. The installer-DMG pipeline is **uncommitted** (`portable/mac/dmg-background.swift`, `dmg-background.png`, `dmg-background@2x.png` are all untracked — confirmed via `git status`). Consequence: the verifier must **not** assume "volume root = just the app," must **never** pin the DMG's codesign Identifier (it's `ShenzhenPDF-installer`), and should discover the payload by globbing (§5.6). **Action for the user:** commit the installer-DMG script before shipping so the verifier's assumptions are source-pinned.

**Reconsider a zip only if** delta/binary-diff updates or a zip-only host appear later — neither applies today.

## Daily lazy update check (launch hook, QoS, 24h throttle, settings keys)

### Launch hook (exact)
Append to the **end of the inner `dispatch_after(kAfterFirstPaintDelay)` block** at the tail of `-applicationDidFinishLaunching` (`ShenzhenPDFMac.mm:865–885`), **inside the existing `if (self.restoreWindowID.length == 0)` gate (line 872)**, after the permissions-wizard / shortcut-help calls, additionally guarded by `!self.detachedTabLaunch`:

```objc
if (self.restoreWindowID.length == 0 && !self.detachedTabLaunch) {
    // ... existing default-reader / permissions wizard / shortcut help ...
    [[SPDFUpdater shared] scheduleDailyUpdateCheckIfNeeded];
}
```

This runs **strictly after first paint** (the block is dispatched after `[_pageScrollView displayIfNeeded]`), **after** `resumePersistentStateSavesAfterLaunch` lifts the save suspension (`:1962`), and **only in the primary user-launched process**. Every restored/detached sibling is a separate process running the same `applicationDidFinishLaunching` (proven by `spawnPendingRestoredWindowsIfNeeded` `:1927–1943` + `--restore-window` / `--detached-tab` parsing in `main()` `:15199–15235`); without this gate, N windows = N checks.

### `scheduleDailyUpdateCheckIfNeeded` body (fail-closed order)
1. `if (spdf_is_sandboxed()) return;` — App Store build never self-updates.
2. `if (!_autoUpdateEnabled) return;` — persisted opt-out.
3. **Cross-process 24h gate.** Open `update.lock` (`O_CREAT|O_RDWR, 0600`), `flock(LOCK_EX)` — copying the exact idiom from `withLockedSessionStore:` (`:1816–1829`). Read `lastUpdateCheck` from `update.json` via `jsonObjectFromFile:` (`:1383`). If `now - lastUpdateCheck < 86400`, unlock and return. Otherwise **write `lastUpdateCheck = now` immediately** (`writeJSONObject:toFile:@"update.json"` `:1399`), then unlock. Stamping **before** the network call means a crash/abort/403 still consumes the day's slot — no hammering. (Note `writeJSONObject` is byte-idempotent and skips unchanged writes at `:1406–1408`; fine, the timestamp changes daily.)
4. **Idle delay:** `dispatch_after(~5s)` on a Background-QoS queue, then run the network check.

### QoS / queue
Use a dedicated `NSOperationQueue` (or `dispatch_get_global_queue`) at **`NSQualityOfServiceBackground`** — strictly below every existing queue (`_renderQueue`/`_findQueue` are UserInitiated; `_preloadQueue` and warming queues are Utility, set `:765–803`). There is no existing Background queue — create one. Do **not** reuse `_preloadQueue` or the launch-tail constants `kAfterFirstPaintDelay` (`:70`) / `…ColdLaunch` (`:78`) — those are tuned for render warming. The updater uses its own ~5s idle delay.

### Settings / state files
In `~/Library/Application Support/ShenzhenPDF` (resolved by `supportDirectory` `:1366`):

| File | Key | Type | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| settings.json | `autoUpdateEnabled` | BOOL | YES (Dev ID build) | gates daily check; menu toggle |
| settings.json | `skippedUpdateVersion` | NSString | nil | tag the user chose to skip permanently |
| update.json | `lastUpdateCheck` | number (epoch) | 0 | once/day gate, stamped pre-network |
| update.json | `highestVersionSeen` | NSString | nil | downgrade/replay high-water mark |
| update.json | `etag` | NSString | nil | `If-None-Match` conditional request |
| update.json | `remindAfter` | number (epoch) | 0 | "Later" snooze for a specific tag (see UI) |
| update.json | `deferredTag` | NSString | nil | tag that `remindAfter` applies to |
| update.json | `updateInProgress` | {pid,timestamp} | absent | cross-process single-driver **liveness lease** |

**Why split files.** `savePersistentState` participates in the launch save-suspension scheme (`_suspendPersistentStateSaves` set YES at `:827`, lifted ~50ms after first paint at `:1962`). Putting the daily timestamp in `settings.json` would defer/coalesce it during launch and force a daily full-settings rewrite. A dedicated `update.json` written via direct `writeJSONObject:toFile:` sidesteps the suspension and is the natural flock unit. `autoUpdateEnabled` / `skippedUpdateVersion` are user prefs and live in `settings.json` (load `:1424–1448`, save `:2001–2005`).

---

## Version comparison

**Self version:** read `CFBundleShortVersionString` + `CFBundleVersion` **directly from `NSBundle.mainBundle.infoDictionary`** (the source `-displayVersion` reads, `:2343–2350`) and join `"YY.M.DD-BUILD"`. **Do not** use the hard-coded `--version` printf at `:15203` (`"Shenzhen PDF portable mac 26.6.25-1"` — a literal that will silently drift from the plist on the next bump). **Fail closed:** if `CFBundleShortVersionString` is missing/unparseable, return **no update** — do **not** fall back to `displayVersion`'s `@"26.6.25"`/`@"1"` literals (`:2347–2348`), which could mask a real release or trigger a spurious install. *(Optional cleanup: fix the `:15203` printf to read the plist so the two never disagree.)*

**Remote version:** the release `tag_name`, same grammar (real tags `26.6.25-1`, `26.6.19-3`, `26.6.11-2`, `26.6.4-1` — month/day/build are **not** zero-padded).

**Comparator `spdf_compare_versions(a, b)`:** split each string on `[. -]` into integer components, compare element-by-element (shorter list zero-padded). **Must be numeric per-field** — lexical compare is provably wrong (`"26.6.25-1" < "26.6.4-1"` lexically but is newer). Treat **YY.M.DD as the primary key**; the `-BUILD` suffix is only a same-day tiebreaker (the build script never passes `MAC_BUILD`, so shipped `CFBundleVersion` may always be `1` even for a `…-2`/`…-3` tag — confirmed `MAC_BUILD` defaults at `Makefile:70`).

**Update available iff ALL hold:**
- `spdf_compare_versions(tag, runningVersion) == NSOrderedDescending`, **and**
- `tag != skippedUpdateVersion`, **and**
- `spdf_compare_versions(tag, highestVersionSeen) == NSOrderedDescending` (downgrade/replay guard), **and**
- release is not `draft` / `prerelease`, **and**
- an asset named exactly `ShenzhenPDF-mac-arm64.dmg` is present.

**`highestVersionSeen` policy (explicit):** advance it whenever a tag is observed as latest from a `200` response (replay/downgrade protection), **independent** of the user's Skip/Later choice. `skippedUpdateVersion` is orthogonal — it suppresses the prompt on the silent daily path only and is ignored on the manual path.

**Unit tests (required, pure functions):**
- `26.6.25 > 26.6.4` (non-padded)
- `26.6.11 > 26.6.4` (multi-digit day)
- `26.6.19-3 > 26.6.19-1` (build tiebreaker)
- `26.6.25-1 == 26.6.25-1` (no update)
- malformed input → ordered-same / no update
- **downgrade feed:** `tag < highestVersionSeen` → no update, even when `tag > running`

## GitHub release check (endpoint, asset pick, rate limits, ETag, failures)

**Endpoint:** `GET https://api.github.com/repos/casimir-engineering/shenzhen-pdf/releases/latest` via `NSURLSession` with `ephemeralSessionConfiguration` (no cookie/cache persistence). Greenfield — zero existing `NSURLSession` in the repo. No ATS exception needed (GitHub hosts are TLS 1.2+).

**Headers:**
- `User-Agent: ShenzhenPDF/<displayVersion> (macOS; +https://github.com/casimir-engineering/shenzhen-pdf)` — **required** (GitHub rejects UA-less requests).
- `Accept: application/vnd.github+json`
- `X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2022-11-28`
- `If-None-Match: <etag>` when a saved `etag` exists.

**Config:** `request.timeoutInterval = 15`; `configuration.waitsForConnectivity = NO` (offline launch fails fast and silently).

**Rate limit (60/hr/IP unauthenticated):** the file-locked once/day gate is the throttle — ≤1 API call per machine per day. Conditional `If-None-Match` requests returning **304 do not count** against the limit. On `304`: no new release, store nothing, return. On `200`: save the new `ETag`.

**Redirect / transport hardening (download phase):** the asset `browser_download_url` is an `api.github.com` redirect to `objects.githubusercontent.com`. Implement `URLSession:task:willPerformHTTPRedirection:` to: **reject any non-`https` hop** (no downgrade to http), **bound the redirect count** (e.g. ≤5), and continue only on https. Cap the download: if `totalBytesExpectedToWrite` (or bytes received) exceeds a sane max (e.g. **64 MB**, ~2× the current 32.6 MB DMG), abort the task.

**Asset selection:** parse `tag_name`, `draft`, `prerelease`, `assets[]`; pick the asset whose `name == "ShenzhenPDF-mac-arm64.dmg"`; capture `browser_download_url` and `size` (and `digest`/`sha256` if present).

**Failure handling (daily path is fully silent):** 403 rate-limit, non-200/non-304, timeout, offline, malformed JSON, missing asset → no-op. `lastUpdateCheck` is already stamped, so the next attempt is tomorrow. The explicit **"Check for Updates…"** menu path runs the same method but **bypasses the 24h gate**, **does not stamp `lastUpdateCheck`**, surfaces both outcomes (up-to-date / available), and routes failures through `-showError:detail:` (`:15189`).

---

## Download → verify → install → relaunch (security gates, atomic swap, rollback)

All steps run off-main on the Background-QoS queue with bounded timeouts; only the consent prompt, progress UI, and final relaunch touch main. Target path is **`NSBundle.mainBundle.bundlePath` resolved at runtime** (the app already self-resolves at `:1930` / `SPDFMacDefaultReader.mm:115`) — **never** hardcode `/Applications/ShenzhenPDF.app`.

**Single-driver liveness lease.** Before starting, take `update.lock` (flock) and write `updateInProgress = {pid: getpid(), timestamp: now}` to `update.json`. On entry, if an existing lease is present, treat it as **stale and reclaim it** when `kill(pid,0) == -1/ESRCH` (driver gone) **or** `timestamp` is older than a ceiling (e.g. 1 hour) — and sweep any orphaned staging dir. Only block when the recorded pid is **alive and recent**. Clear the lease on every exit path. This prevents a crash/SIGKILL mid-update from permanently wedging all future checks. Also keep an in-process flag so the same process clicking "Check for Updates…" while its own daily download is running takes the fast "already in progress" path.

### 5.0 Translocation guard (before anything)
If `bundlePath` contains `/AppTranslocation/` or is under `/private/var/folders` (Gatekeeper App Translocation), or the app is running from a DMG/Downloads, the bundle path is a throwaway shadow copy. **Do not self-update.** Show: *"To enable automatic updates, move Shenzhen PDF to your Applications folder."* (Moving the app clears quarantine/translocation, mirroring `install-mac-from-source.sh:86` `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine`.)

### 5.1 Staging dir
`[NSFileManager URLForDirectory:NSItemReplacementDirectory inDomain:NSUserDomainMask appropriateForURL:bundleURL.parentURL create:YES]` — guarantees the temp dir is on the **same volume** as the install target so the final rename is atomic. Pre-check free space ≥ ~3× DMG size before downloading. On launch, sweep stale `NSItemReplacementDirectory` staging dirs left by an interrupted prior run.

### 5.2 Download
`NSURLSession downloadTaskWithURL:` on the asset URL. Drive a **determinate** progress bar whose `maxValue` is wired to the **API `asset.size`** (not `totalBytesExpectedToWrite`, which is `-1` for chunked/CDN responses). Compute "X MB of Y MB" from `totalBytesWritten / asset.size`. Only fall back to indeterminate if `asset.size` was absent.

### 5.3 Content integrity (corruption heuristic ONLY — not a trust boundary)
- Reject if downloaded length `!= asset.size`.
- If the API exposed a `sha256` digest, compute `CC_SHA256` over a streamed read and reject on mismatch.

> **Adversary model:** `browser_download_url`, `size`, and any API `digest` all arrive over the **same channel**, so a full-channel MITM can lie about them consistently. These checks catch corruption, **never tampering**. **Never branch a trust decision on the API digest.** The only anti-tamper boundary is §5.4/§5.6.

### 5.4 Verify the DMG offline (BEFORE mounting) — exact gates
Use **Security.framework in-process** (not PATH-hijackable in a non-sandboxed process). **`#import <Security/Security.h>`; this requires linking `-framework Security` (see Implementation outline) — without it the build fails to link.**

- `SecStaticCodeCreateWithPath(dmgURL, …, &code)`.
- `SecRequirementCreateWithString(req, …)` with a **full Developer ID requirement**, not just an OU match:
  ```
  anchor apple generic and
  certificate leaf[subject.OU] = "66LJ4BV7Q3" and
  certificate 1[field.1.2.840.113635.100.6.2.6] exists and
  certificate leaf[field.1.2.840.113635.100.6.1.13] exists
  ```
  (pins the Apple Worldwide Developer Relations intermediate + the Developer ID Application leaf marker, so a leaf from any other Apple-anchored program with the same OU cannot satisfy it).
- `SecStaticCodeCheckValidityWithErrors(code, kSecCSDefaultFlags, req, &err)`.
- Independently `SecCodeCopySigningInformation(code, kSecCSSigningInformation, &info)` and assert `info[kSecCodeInfoTeamIdentifier] == @"66LJ4BV7Q3"`. **Pin the Team ID, NEVER the DMG codesign Identifier** (it is the hdiutil-generated `ShenzhenPDF-installer`, verified live — an Identifier pin would break).

**Notarization — offline, authoritative on the stapled ticket:**
- The DMG carries a valid **stapled ticket** (verified live: `stapler validate <dmg>` succeeds). **Require the embedded/stapled ticket to be present and valid** — `SecAssessmentTicketLookup` against the embedded ticket, or `SecStaticCodeCheckValidityWithErrors` against a requirement that includes notarization.
- **Policy (no fail-open):** absence or invalidity of the embedded ticket is a **hard rejection**. A properly stapled DMG must **pass even when the machine is offline** (the ticket is embedded). **Never** fall back to an online assessment that a MITM/offline attacker could influence. `SecAssessment`/`spctl` may touch the network; use them only as best-effort corroboration with a short timeout — a network timeout alone must **not** abort an install whose signature + Team ID + stapled ticket already verified offline. CLI fallbacks, if used, must use **absolute paths** (`/usr/bin/xcrun stapler validate`, `/usr/sbin/spctl -a -t open --context context:primary-signature`).

**Abort on any verification failure**, routed to a verification-failed message that does **not** offer to install.

### 5.5 Mount read-only
`/usr/bin/hdiutil attach -nobrowse -readonly -noautoopen -plist <dmg>` via NSTask. Parse the returned plist and read the **real mount-point** solely from `system-entities` of **this attach's** output — **never** construct or assume `/Volumes/Shenzhen PDF` (a user's pre-mounted copy lands at `/Volumes/Shenzhen PDF 1`; verified the volname forces the mount point). Wrap the whole mount scope so it **detaches the exact returned mount-point in every exit path** (success, verify-fail, exception), with `hdiutil detach -force` fallback. Do **not** pre-detach a pre-existing user mount.

### 5.6 Extract + re-verify the inner .app (do NOT assume layout or inner stapling)
- **Discover the payload by globbing the mount**, not by hardcoding `<mount>/ShenzhenPDF.app`: scan for the single **non-symlink** `*.app` whose `CFBundleIdentifier == com.intuition.shenzhenpdf`; **skip the `Applications` symlink and `.background`**; abort if zero or >1 match.
- `/usr/bin/ditto "<discovered.app>" "<staging>/ShenzhenPDF.app"` (preserves signature + xattrs + any ticket).
- **Re-verify the extracted app offline via SecStaticCode** (always available, genuinely offline):
  - Same full Developer ID requirement + `kSecCodeInfoTeamIdentifier == 66LJ4BV7Q3`.
  - Assert the **hardened-runtime flag** (`info[kSecCodeInfoFlags] & 0x10000`, verified present live).
  - Assert `CFBundleIdentifier == com.intuition.shenzhenpdf` (this bundle-id pin applies to the **app**, never the DMG).
  - Assert the extracted bundle's `CFBundleShortVersionString` equals the tag's `YY.M.DD` (catches asset/tag mismatch or swapped payload).
- **Inner-app notarization is best-effort, not required.** The committed pipeline staples **only the DMG** (`Makefile:137`), so the extracted `.app` may carry no ticket of its own. The **authoritative notarization gate is the DMG-level stapled ticket already verified in §5.4** — it covers the payload. Re-asserting the inner app's Developer ID + Team ID + hardened-runtime + bundle-id offline is sufficient; do **not** make a passing inner-app *notarization* assessment a precondition (that would brick legit updates whenever the DMG-only build path is used).

### 5.7 Detach + strip quarantine
`/usr/bin/hdiutil detach <real-mount-point>` (force on failure) in the cleanup/finally path; delete the temp DMG. `/usr/bin/xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "<staging>/ShenzhenPDF.app"` to avoid Gatekeeper translocation. **Never** execute the app from the mounted DMG or a quarantined/translocated dir. *(Note: files written by our own non-sandboxed process aren't auto-quarantined, so the downloaded DMG should mount cleanly; strip defensively anyway.)*

### 5.8 Quit sibling processes (bounded, with escalation)
Each window is a separate process holding the old bundle's text pages, so all must fully exit before the swap. Before quitting, the `updateInProgress` lease is already set so a waking sibling won't start its own update. Enumerate via `otherRunningShenzhenApplications` (`:1898–1906`). To avoid the N² terminate storm (each process's `applicationShouldTerminate` re-broadcasts `[app terminate]` to others; the guard `gSPDFTerminatingAllWindows` `:395` / `_terminateOnlyThisProcess` `:713` is process-local), have the driver send each sibling a "quit for update" request that sets `_terminateOnlyThisProcess = YES` so siblings don't re-cascade. The detached helper (§5.9) then **polls for zero instances with a bounded timeout (~10–20s)**; on timeout, escalate to `forceTerminate`; if instances still remain, **abort the swap** (bundle untouched), clear the lease, relaunch the original, and show *"Please quit all Shenzhen PDF windows and try again."* — the user is never left without a running app.

### 5.9 Atomic swap via detached helper (run from the CURRENT, trusted binary)
**Critically: spawn the swap helper from the CURRENTLY-RUNNING in-place binary** (known-good, already verified, not translocated) — **not** from the staged binary. Pass the staged path as an argument:
`--post-update <stagedAppPath> <targetBundlePath>`, parsed in `main()`. The §5.6 verification gate is a **hard predecessor** to executing any staged code: no unverified staged binary is ever exec'd; the staged app is exec'd only **after** it has been renamed into the final target path and re-registered.

**`main()` short-circuit (exact):** detect `--post-update` in the **first argv loop** (the same one that handles `--version` at `:15201–15206` and already `return 0`s without touching the delegate). Run the entire swap/relaunch helper inline as a plain Foundation function (no AppKit, no `NSApplication`, no `startLaunchPrerender` at `:15224`) and `return 0;` **before** constructing `ShenzhenMacDelegate`. Spawn the helper with the existing NSTask self-launch idiom (`executableURL`, std fds → `/dev/null`, `launchAndReturnError:`, `:1936–1941` / `:8244–8251`), and have the helper `setsid()` to detach from the parent's process group so it survives the parent's exit and the sibling-terminate cascade. Parent then exits.

The detached helper:
1. **Bounded poll** until zero running instances (§5.8). A short settle delay after exit (kernel map release).
2. **Probe writability by attempting the operation**, not by trusting `access(W_OK)` (which misses ACL/ownership/SIP edge cases). Current state: `/Applications` is `drwxrwxr-x root:admin`, the `.app` `raph:admin`.
3. **Swap — move-aside two-rename is PRIMARY** (battle-tested, matches the rest of this codebase's plain-`rename` usage; `renamex_np(RENAME_SWAP)` has **zero existing use** here and is fragile around firmlinks/mapped bundles):
   - `rename(bundlePath → bundlePath.old)`, then `rename(stagedApp → bundlePath)`.
   - `renamex_np(stagedApp, bundlePath, RENAME_SWAP)` is an **optional optimization** gated behind a same-volume + availability check; handle `EINVAL`/`ENOENT` (target missing) by falling through to the two-rename.
4. **Re-register Launch Services on the FINAL path:** `LSRegisterURL((CFURLRef)finalBundleURL, true)` (idiom at `SPDFMacDefaultReader.mm:115`) or `lsregister -f` — before relaunch, so LS never resolves a stale record.
5. **Relaunch** the new binary with **no path argument** so the standard restore path fans the **full multi-window session** back out (`:1499–1505` / `:1927–1943`): `NSWorkspace openApplicationAtURL:configuration:` (`:14191–14195`). Verify the relaunched app runs from the **real** `/Applications` path, not a translocated copy.
6. **Health signal + `.old` cleanup:** the relaunched process, on a successful `applicationDidFinishLaunching`, writes `update_ok <newVersion>` to `update.json` (under `update.lock`) and shows the one-time "now on `<newTag>`" confirmation. The helper (or the next launch) deletes `bundlePath.old` **only after** seeing that marker; otherwise it rolls back.

### 5.10 Rollback
If move-in fails after move-aside, `rename(bundlePath.old → bundlePath)` to restore the working install. Retain `.old` until the new version confirms healthy (§5.9.6); if the **new** version also fails to launch / never writes `update_ok` within a window, the next launch rolls `.old` back and reveals it in Finder. **Never** `rm -rf` the running bundle (unlike the `Makefile install:` target `:186`, which assumes the app isn't running).

### 5.11 Not-writable fallback
If the actual rename attempt fails on bundle or parent (installed by another admin / root-owned / hardened `/Applications`): **do not** attempt sudo (no privileged-helper infra exists). Re-mount the DMG, reveal it in Finder, and `showError:` instructions to drag `ShenzhenPDF.app` to `/Applications` (the manual-update gesture). A future `SMAppService` privileged helper is the path to silent privileged install.

## UI interactions (every state, concrete copy, menu placement; non-intrusive)

All updater UI is **built only in the non-sandboxed build** (gate creation on `!spdf_is_sandboxed()`), and every action **re-checks the gate at runtime** (one binary, two builds). Reuse existing AppKit surfaces; the only new view is a cloned progress panel.

### Menu placement (`-buildMenu` `:2058`, app-menu block `:2063–2072`)
Insert a separator-bounded group **between "About Shenzhen PDF" (`:2064`) and "Set Up Permissions…" (`:2066`)**:
- **"Check for Updates…"** → `@selector(checkForUpdates:)`
- **"Automatically check for updates"** (checkbox) → `@selector(toggleAutomaticUpdateChecks:)`

### validateMenuItem (`-validateMenuItem:` `:15090`)
The no-document fallthrough at `:15175` (`if (!hasDoc) return action == @selector(unimplementedMenuItem:);`) disables any non-whitelisted selector when no document is open — the common cold-launch updater scenario. Therefore:
- Add `checkForUpdates:` to the always-enabled whitelist (`:15093–15101`). Keep it **always enabled** (don't gate on a cross-process file read in this hot path).
- Add a dedicated clause **before `:15175`** for `toggleAutomaticUpdateChecks:`: `menuItem.state = _autoUpdateEnabled ? On : Off; return YES;` (mirrors `toggleDefaultMinimapForNewDocuments:` `:15106`).

### States & copy

**A. Idle / silent.** Daily background check shows nothing on no-update or any failure.

**B. Update available — non-intrusive presentation (no focus theft).** The daily path fires ~5s after first paint on a background queue, by which point the user may be in another app. **Do not `runModal` and do not steal focus.**
- If `NSApp.isActive`: present a **non-activating sheet** on `_window` via `beginSheetModalForWindow:completionHandler:` (never `runModal` from a background context).
- If not active: **defer** — set a lightweight menu/About affordance and surface the sheet on the next `applicationDidBecomeActive`.
- The explicit "Check for Updates…" path (user just asked) may use a modal/centered alert when `_window == nil`.
- Copy — messageText: **"A new version of Shenzhen PDF is available"**; informativeText: **"Shenzhen PDF `<newTag>` is available — you have `<displayVersion>`. Would you like to install it now?"** (+ optional release notes, see below).
- Buttons in order: **"Install and Relaunch"** (`NSAlertFirstButtonReturn`), **"Skip This Version"** (`NSAlertSecondButtonReturn` → persist `skippedUpdateVersion = tag`), **"Later"** (`NSAlertThirdButtonReturn`).
- **Nag cap (no daily re-prompt):** "Later" sets `deferredTag = tag` + `remindAfter = now + 7 days`; the silent daily path suppresses re-prompts for that exact tag until `remindAfter`. "Skip This Version" is the permanent per-version suppression. The silent path respects both `skippedUpdateVersion` and `remindAfter`; the explicit menu path ignores both.

**C. Downloading** — clone the determinate translation progress panel (`:12376–12448`): `NSPanel` (titled) + `NSProgressIndicator` (Bar, `indeterminate=NO`, `maxValue = asset.size`) + semibold title **"Downloading Shenzhen PDF `<newTag>`"** + truncating-middle detail **"12.4 MB of 30.1 MB"** + **Cancel**. Cancel aborts the URLSession task, cleans staging, detaches the DMG.

**D. Verifying / preparing** — flip the bar to indeterminate (`startAnimation:`, as `:12444`) with detail **"Verifying signature…"** then **"Preparing update…"**. Post an accessibility announcement on each phase change so VoiceOver reads it.

**E. Ready to install — honest disruptive confirm (point of no return).** Because install quits **all** windows/processes and reopens them, before kicking the detached helper show: messageText **"Shenzhen PDF will close all windows and reopen them to finish updating."**, buttons **"Install Now"** / **"Cancel"**. The moment "Install Now" is accepted and the helper launches, **disable/dismiss Cancel** — after that, the only control is the helper's bounded-wait state, so the user can never believe they aborted while the swap proceeds.

**E′. Waiting for windows to close** — while the helper polls (§5.8): a non-modal status **"Waiting for other windows to close…"** with a Cancel that aborts cleanly (bundle untouched) until the point of no return.

**F. Up to date** (explicit check only) — `NSAlert`: **"You're up to date."** / **"Shenzhen PDF `<displayVersion>` is the latest version."**

**G. Failure** — every error funnels through `-showError:detail:` (`:15189`). The **verification failure** message must **not** offer to install: **"The update could not be verified and was not installed."** If a swap succeeds but relaunch fails (or rollback fires), reveal the restored bundle in Finder so the user is never left appless.

**H. Already in progress** — when the user clicks "Check for Updates…": take `update.lock`; if a **live, recent** lease exists, show **"An update is already in progress."** (the daily auto-path returns silently). This moves the cross-process check off the validate hot path.

**I. Post-update success** — keyed off the `--post-update`/`update_ok` marker: a one-time confirmation **"You're now on Shenzhen PDF `<newTag>`."** after the disruptive relaunch.

### About panel (`-showAboutPanel:` `:2352`)
Under the version label (`:2380–2384`), **non-sandboxed only**, add a borderless link-style **"Check for Updates"** button calling `checkForUpdates:`. Give it an accessibility role of button + clear label, and make it keyboard-focusable. Tolerate `_window == nil` (`[panel center]`). `showAboutPanel:` is already whitelisted, so no validate change. **Do not** use `_statusLabel` (created `:3043`, never added to a view hierarchy) for any banner.

### Release notes (state B, optional)
The GitHub release `body` is published manually (no `--notes` step in the Makefile pipeline), so it may be empty or arbitrary Markdown. **Plain-text only:** strip/escape Markdown, cap to ~500 chars + a "Read more on GitHub" button opening the release URL via `NSWorkspace`, and omit the section gracefully when empty. **Never** render untrusted Markdown as rich/attributed text.

**Accessibility:** all alert buttons have distinct self-describing titles; Esc → "Later"/"Cancel", Return → primary; post `NSAccessibility` announcements when indeterminate-phase detail text changes; set `accessibilityValue` on the progress indicator.

**Non-intrusiveness guarantees:** silent on no-update and all failures; surfaces a prompt only for an actionable, non-skipped, non-snoozed newer version; scheduled strictly post-first-paint on Background QoS; never steals focus from another app; nothing downloads or relaunches without an explicit click (no silent pre-download in v1).

---

## Settings, opt-out & build gating (Developer ID only; never in the sandboxed TestFlight build)

**Sandbox detection — add `spdf_is_sandboxed()`** (none exists; only prose comments at `:1679–1729`):
- Primary: `SecCodeCopySelf` → `SecCodeCopySigningInformation(self, kSecCSDynamicInformation, &info)` → inspect `info[kSecCodeInfoEntitlementsDict]` for `com.apple.security.app-sandbox == true`. The Dev ID app has **empty entitlements** (verified live); the App Store app signs with `mac/TestFlight.entitlements` + an embedded provisioning profile (`Makefile:102–104, 115`).
- Cheap corroboration: `getenv("APP_SANDBOX_CONTAINER_ID") != NULL`.

**Every** entry point — daily check, both menu items, About affordance, all action bodies, `--post-update` — early-returns when sandboxed. The gate is **runtime**, not just compile-time (one binary, two builds). Rationale: (a) the App Store updates MAS installs; (b) the sandbox forbids replacing `/Applications/*.app` and spawning the relaunch helper — *not* "no network" (TestFlight.entitlements grants `com.apple.security.network.client`).

**Settings (user prefs, `settings.json`):**
- `autoUpdateEnabled` (BOOL, default YES for Dev ID) — load `:1424–1448` (`NSNumber* x = settings[@"key"]; if (x) _ivar = x.boolValue;`), save `:2001–2005`, mirroring `showShortcutHelpOnLaunch`. Toggled by the menu checkbox (calls `savePersistentState`).
- `skippedUpdateVersion` (NSString) — same load/save path.

**Opt-out:** unticking "Automatically check for updates" sets `autoUpdateEnabled = NO` → daily check early-returns at step 2; the manual "Check for Updates…" still works. A future Preferences window can bind `autoUpdateEnabled` directly; today the menu checkbox + About affordance are the surface.

## Security model & threats mitigated

| Threat | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| **MITM / compromised CDN serving a malicious payload** | The **only** trust boundary is the offline Developer ID signature + Team ID `66LJ4BV7Q3` pin + valid **stapled notarization ticket** on the file actually written to disk (§5.4/§5.6). Size/SHA-256 are corruption heuristics, never trust decisions. |
| **Forged "Dev-ID-but-unnotarized" DMG forced offline** | Stapled ticket is **required** and validated offline; absence/invalidity = hard reject. **Never** fail open to an online assessment a MITM could influence. |
| **Leaf cert from another Apple-anchored program with same OU** | Requirement pins the WWDR intermediate marker (`…6.2.6`) + Developer ID Application leaf marker (`…6.1.13`), not just OU. |
| **Wrong-Identifier pin breaking legit updates** | Pin Team ID, never the DMG Identifier (`ShenzhenPDF-installer`, verified) nor the inner-app-only bundle id on the DMG. |
| **Downgrade / replay (old signed release re-offered)** | `highestVersionSeen` high-water mark; numeric per-field comparator; `draft`/`prerelease` excluded. |
| **Transport downgrade / redirect abuse / zip-bomb** | https-only on every redirect hop, bounded redirect count, capped response size (~64 MB). |
| **PATH-hijack of `codesign`/`spctl`** | Security.framework **in-process**; CLI fallbacks use absolute paths only. |
| **Executing unverified staged code** | Swap helper runs from the **current trusted in-place binary**; staged binary exec'd only **after** §5.6 verification **and** after it's renamed into the final path. |
| **Rate-limit abuse / launch impact** | flock'd once/day gate stamped pre-network; Background QoS; strictly post-first-paint. |
| **Crash mid-update wedging all future updates** | `updateInProgress` is a **liveness lease** (pid + timestamp) that is reclaimed when the pid is dead or the lease is stale. |
| **Sandboxed MAS build self-updating** | Hard runtime gate on `spdf_is_sandboxed()` at every entry point. |
| **App Translocation corrupting the swap target** | Refuse to self-update from a translocated/DMG path; instruct user to move to `/Applications`. |
| **Untrusted release-notes Markdown injection** | Plain-text only, escaped, length-capped. |

## Open decisions for the user (each with a recommended default)

1. **Commit the installer-DMG pipeline before shipping the updater.** The shipped DMG (layout + `Applications` symlink + `ShenzhenPDF-installer` Identifier) is produced by **untracked** scripts (`dmg-background.swift`, `dmg-background.png`, `dmg-background@2x.png`), so the verifier's assumptions aren't source-pinned. **Recommended: commit them first**, and consider adding `xcrun stapler staple "$(MAC_APP)"` before `hdiutil create` so the inner app is deterministically stapled (defense-in-depth; the design does not require it).

2. **Post-"Later" snooze window.** **Recommended: 7 days** per tag, then re-surface. (Alternative: 3 days, or no re-prompt until a newer tag.)

3. **`renamex_np(RENAME_SWAP)` as an optimization?** **Recommended: skip it in v1** — ship the move-aside two-rename only; it's simpler and matches existing codebase patterns. Add `RENAME_SWAP` later if measured churn warrants.

4. **Release-notes display.** **Recommended: show a plain-text, length-capped excerpt + "Read more on GitHub"**, gracefully omitted when empty. (Alternative: omit notes entirely in v1 and just link to the release.)

5. **Privileged install for read-only `/Applications`.** **Recommended: v1 falls back to the manual drag-to-Applications instruction**; defer an `SMAppService` privileged helper to a later version.

6. **Sandbox detection signal.** **Recommended: entitlements-dict primary + `APP_SANDBOX_CONTAINER_ID` corroboration**, as specified.

7. **Fix the hard-coded `--version` printf (`:15203`)** to read the plist, as a small separate cleanup so it can't drift from the real version. **Recommended: yes.**

## Implementation outline (new files + edit points)

### New files
**`portable/mac/SPDFUpdater.h`**
- `+ (instancetype)shared;`
- `- (void)scheduleDailyUpdateCheckIfNeeded;`
- `- (void)checkForUpdatesUserInitiated:(BOOL)userInitiated;`
- free fns: `BOOL spdf_is_sandboxed(void);`, `NSComparisonResult spdf_compare_versions(NSString*, NSString*);`, `BOOL spdf_verify_signed_bundle(NSURL*, BOOL isApp, NSError**);`

**`portable/mac/SPDFUpdater.mm`** (`#import <Security/Security.h>`)
- `spdf_is_sandboxed()` (entitlements dict + getenv corroboration).
- `spdf_compare_versions()` (split on `[. -]`, integer per-field).
- `scheduleDailyUpdateCheckIfNeeded` (sandbox gate → autoUpdate gate → flock 24h gate → Background-QoS dispatch_after).
- `performNetworkCheck` (ephemeral NSURLSession, headers, ETag/304, https-only redirect + size cap, asset selection, version compare, `highestVersionSeen` update).
- progress panel clone (`:12376–12448`) + `updateDownloadProgress:detail:`.
- download task + content-integrity (size + optional CC_SHA256).
- `spdf_verify_signed_bundle` (SecStaticCode + full Dev-ID requirement + Team-ID + hardened-runtime + bundle-id for apps).
- DMG verify (stapled-ticket authoritative offline; SecAssessment best-effort; absolute-path CLI fallback).
- mount (hdiutil `-plist`, real mount-point from `system-entities`), glob-discover inner `.app`, ditto extract, re-verify, detach (finally), xattr strip.
- liveness-lease helpers + sibling-quit (bounded, `forceTerminate` escalation) + detached `--post-update` spawn (from current binary, `setsid`).
- `update.json`/`update.lock` read-modify-write helpers (flock idiom from `:1816`).

**`portable/mac/SPDFUpdaterTests.mm`** — the 6 comparator/downgrade cases in *Version comparison*.

### Edits to `portable/mac/ShenzhenPDFMac.mm`
- **`:865–885`** post-first-paint tail: add `[[SPDFUpdater shared] scheduleDailyUpdateCheckIfNeeded];` inside `if (self.restoreWindowID.length == 0 && !self.detachedTabLaunch)`.
- **`:764–803`** (optional) add an `_updateQueue` (`NSQualityOfServiceBackground`) ivar, or use the global Background queue.
- **`:1424–1448`** `loadPersistentState`: read `autoUpdateEnabled` (default YES), `skippedUpdateVersion`.
- **`:2001–2005`** `savePersistentState`: write the same two keys.
- **`:2058` / `:2063–2072`** `buildMenu`: insert the two updater items (gated `!spdf_is_sandboxed()`); add `checkForUpdates:` + `toggleAutomaticUpdateChecks:` action methods that forward to `SPDFUpdater` (runtime sandbox re-check).
- **`:2352` / `:2380–2384`** `showAboutPanel:`: add the non-sandboxed "Check for Updates" link button.
- **`:15090–15101`** `validateMenuItem:`: whitelist `checkForUpdates:`; add the `toggleAutomaticUpdateChecks:` state clause before `:15175`.
- **`:15201–15206`** `main()` first argv loop: parse `--post-update <stagedAppPath> <targetBundlePath>`, run the inline Foundation-only swap/relaunch helper, `return 0;` **before** delegate construction / `startLaunchPrerender` (`:15224`) / `NSApplication`.
- New delegate ivars: `BOOL _autoUpdateEnabled;` (init YES), `NSString* _skippedUpdateVersion;`.
- *(Optional)* fix the hard-coded `--version` printf at `:15203` to read the plist.

### Edits to `portable/Makefile`
- **`:95`** add **`-framework Security`** to the `$(MAC_BIN)` link line (**required**, not optional — verified absent; `SecStaticCode`/`SecRequirement`/`SecCode`/`SecAssessment` won't link without it). Keep `-framework CoreServices` (LaunchServices).
- Add `SPDFUpdater.mm` to `MAC_SRCS`; add a `SPDFUpdaterTests` target linking `-framework Cocoa -framework Security` (mirror the test target at `:59`).
- No release-pipeline change: continue shipping only the DMG. *(Separately recommended: commit the installer-DMG script; optionally add `xcrun stapler staple "$(MAC_APP)"` before `hdiutil create` at `:121`.)*

## How we'll test it safely

1. **Comparator unit tests** — build/run `SPDFUpdaterTests`: the 6 cases (non-padded, multi-digit day, build tiebreaker, equality, malformed, downgrade-feed). Pure functions, no I/O.

2. **Sandbox gate** — temporary debug log in `spdf_is_sandboxed()`; run the Dev ID build (expect `NO`, updater present) and a locally sandbox-signed build (`codesign --entitlements mac/TestFlight.entitlements`, expect `YES`, updater absent from menu).

3. **Network check in isolation (no install)** — hidden `--check-updates-now` argv flag (Dev ID only) running `performNetworkCheck` with `userInitiated=YES`, logging parsed `tag_name`/asset/decision and **stopping before download**. Verify ETag/304 by running twice; verify the 24h gate by inspecting `update.json`.

4. **Verification gates against the real artifact** — point the verifier at local `dist/ShenzhenPDF-mac-arm64.dmg` (notarized+stapled, Team `66LJ4BV7Q3`, verified live) → expect pass. Negative tests, each must fail before the swap: (a) ad-hoc re-sign (`codesign -f -s -`) → Team-ID/Dev-ID requirement fails; (b) flip a byte → SecStaticCode validity fails; (c) different-team DMG → requirement fails; (d) strip the stapled ticket → notarization gate fails; (e) DMG with a payload `.app` whose `CFBundleShortVersionString` ≠ tag → §5.6 version assert fails.

5. **Install/swap against a throwaway target — never `/Applications` first:**
   - Copy the app to `/tmp/ShenzhenTest/ShenzhenPDF.app`, launch from there (updater targets `NSBundle.mainBundle.bundlePath`).
   - Stage a fake "newer" DMG: bump `CFBundleShortVersionString`, **re-sign with the same Developer ID + staple**, host on `python3 -m http.server`, point a debug `updateFeedURL` override at a hand-written `releases/latest` JSON.
   - Exercise the full flow: move-aside swap, `.old` retention, `update_ok` health marker, relaunch from the new binary, post-update success banner, and rollback (make the staged app unverifiable mid-swap).
   - Liveness lease: kill the driver mid-download, confirm the next run reclaims the stale lease.
   - Not-writable fallback: `chmod a-w /tmp/ShenzhenTest` → expect the drag-to-Applications instruction, no crash.
   - **Multi-process:** open 2–3 windows (separate processes), trigger install from one; confirm siblings terminate (with a wedged-sibling timeout/forceTerminate test), only one process drives the swap (others see "already in progress"), and the **full multi-window session is restored** after relaunch.
   - Translocation: run a quarantined copy from a mounted DMG → expect the "move to Applications" message, no swap.

6. **Per MEMORY constraint:** after any test launch, **kill the app and restore `session.json`** before finishing.

Only after all of the above passes against `/tmp` should you test a real `/Applications` self-update on a recoverable machine.

---

**Key load-bearing facts verified live this session:** `Makefile:137` staples only the DMG (no inner-app recursion); `-framework Security` is **absent** from the link line (`Makefile:95`); the installer-DMG assets (`dmg-background.swift`/`.png`/`@2x.png`) are **untracked**; DMG codesign `Identifier = ShenzhenPDF-installer` and `stapler validate <dmg>` succeeds (stapled, Dev ID, Team `66LJ4BV7Q3`).
