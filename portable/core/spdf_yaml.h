 * Strict YAML subset codec for ShenzhenPDF's human-readable state files
 * (settings/session/documents/favorites/bookmarks). Both frontends keep
 * building/consuming JSON internally and convert at the file boundary, so one
 * codec serves the AppKit and GTK apps.
 *
 * Supported YAML subset (everything the app emits, plus reasonable human
 * edits):
 *   - block mappings and block sequences, 2-space indentation on emit,
 *     any consistent deeper indentation on parse (a sequence may also sit at
 *     the same indent as its parent key, as humans commonly write)
 *   - scalars: double-quoted strings (\" \\ \/ \b \f \n \r \t \uXXXX escapes,
 *     UTF-16 surrogate pairs), single-quoted strings ('' for '), plain
 *     numbers (JSON grammar), true/false, null/~
 *   - empty containers as {} and []
 *   - full-line comments (# ...), trailing comments after values, blank
 *     lines, trailing whitespace, an optional leading --- document marker
 * NOT supported (never emitted): anchors, aliases, tags, non-empty flow
 * style, block scalars (| and >), multi-document streams.
 *
 * Emit rules keep files diffable: key order is preserved from the JSON input
 * (frontends emit sorted/fixed-order JSON), strings are always double-quoted,
 * numbers/bools pass through as verbatim tokens so a load/save cycle is
 * byte-stable.
