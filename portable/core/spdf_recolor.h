/* Document-agnostic dark-reading recolor for rendered page pixmaps.
 *
 * Every fixed-layout format the reader opens (PDF, XPS, CBZ, EPUB/MOBI, plain
 * images) reaches the frontends as one RGBA byte buffer produced by
 * spdf_render_page_*_rgba(). Recoloring that buffer is therefore the single
 * place where "dark mode" can be made to work for all of them at once, without
 * touching a format handler.
 *
 * The transform is LUMA REMAP: for each pixel we compute Rec.601 luma Y, invert
 * it, and remap the inverted value onto the reading theme's paper..ink ramp;
 * the resulting per-channel offset is added to R, G and B alike. Because the
 * SAME offset lands on all three channels, the channel differences (R-G, G-B),
 * i.e. the chroma, survive: a red logo stays red instead of flipping to cyan
 * the way a per-channel inversion (fz_invert_pixmap / fz_tint_pixmap /
 * SumatraPDF's UpdateBitmapColors) would flip it. Paper white lands exactly on
 * the theme paper color and body black lands exactly on the theme ink color,
 * so a recolored PDF page and a dark-themed Markdown page agree pixel for
 * pixel on background and text.
 *
 * Cost is one 256-entry table lookup plus three adds and three clamps per
 * pixel, with no table lookup and no floating point; the per-theme constants
 * are computed once by spdf_recolor_table_init(), not once per page.
 *
 * The transform is fused into copy_pixmap_to_bitmap() in shenzhen_pdf_core.c,
 * the single tail of every render path, so it rides the row that pass has just
 * written while it is still in L1 rather than costing a second walk of the
 * whole image. It is a SCREEN transform only: print and export never opt in,
 * because a PDF's colors are the document's own content.
