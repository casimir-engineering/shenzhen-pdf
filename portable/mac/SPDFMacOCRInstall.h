// The fonts are a separate step because they are needed by a machine that is
// already fully installed: ocrmypdf renders the recognised text into the
// output PDF, and without a font carrying those glyphs it logs
//   "No font found with glyphs for 'chi_sim' text. Install NotoSansCJK-Regular
//    for better rendering."
// and falls back, so a Chinese datasheet comes out with a degraded text layer.
// Nobody who installed OCR before this existed would ever re-enter the
// installer, so the fonts are fetched at OCR time instead (see
// -ensureOCRFontsForLanguage:).

// The tesseract language codes that need the CJK font, and the font files a
// given `+`-joined language string requires. Pure, so the mapping is testable.
