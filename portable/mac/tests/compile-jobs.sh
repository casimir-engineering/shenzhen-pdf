# Bounded parallel compilation for the hand-rolled macOS test drivers.
#
# Sourced, not executed. The Markdown suites link a large fixed set of shared
# translation units into every test binary; compiling each one ONCE and linking
# the objects is the whole point, and doing those compiles concurrently is what
# keeps the suites in seconds rather than minutes.
#
# Usage:
#     . "$SCRIPT_DIR/compile-jobs.sh"
#     spdf_job "$CXX" $CXXFLAGS -c "$SRC" -o "$OBJ"
#     ...
#     spdf_join    # waits for everything; exits nonzero if any compile failed
#
# spdf_join deliberately reaps every job before failing, so a broken build
# prints all of the compiler's diagnostics instead of only the first one.
