// back on the main one (measured: saved y 1319, restored y 487).

// back on the main one). Grouped here because they are one step -- "make this

// the built-in screen was attached, came back clamped to the built-in screen's
// visible frame -- and saving that clamp destroyed the remembered position for
// good. So the fallback is display-only. Until the reader actually moves or
// resizes the window, the frame they left is what gets saved.
