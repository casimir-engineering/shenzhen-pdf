// SELECTION translation only needs text, so it works on any tab that has a
// selection it may copy — a Markdown tab included, since Markdown has no
// copy-permission concept at all.
//
// WHOLE-DOCUMENT translation rewrites a rendered PDF in place: translated lines
// are drawn back at each source line's position, page by page, through the
// mupdf render path. A Markdown tab has no such geometry of its own, so it is
// first rendered to a PDF — the same rendition Save as PDF writes — and that
// PDF is what gets translated. It is therefore available on both kinds of tab.
