// on a middle-click at all. Declines when there is nothing to do (already the

// undone, and it cannot be repaired afterwards: a later -makeKeyWindow /
// -makeMainWindow / -makeKeyAndOrderFront: is refused outright, because AppKit
// is still waiting for a mouse-down it will never see. The window server, which
// tracks the front window independently, does consider the window main — so the
// keyboard keeps working (key events route by window number, not by key status)
// while everything drawn from key state, the traffic lights above all, stays
// grey. A press matching this predicate must therefore reach super BEFORE any
// handler can swallow it.
