// The app-level half of "rotate a Markdown document": the two rotate commands
// (menu items, their shortcuts, and the toolbar) reaching the session's paper.
//
// On a PDF, rotating turns the rendered page — the pixels themselves come out
// sideways, which is what a scanned page needs. A Markdown document has no
// rendered page to turn; it is text poured onto A4. So the same command turns
// the PAPER instead: portrait becomes landscape, the document re-flows onto the
// wider, shorter sheet, and every glyph stays upright. Nothing rotates.
//
// The choice lives on the TAB (persisted as "markdownLandscape"), not on the
// app, so two Markdown tabs can sit in different orientations and each comes
// back the way it was left. -loadSelectedMarkdownTab: hands it to the session
// before activation, exactly like the font scale and the reading theme.
